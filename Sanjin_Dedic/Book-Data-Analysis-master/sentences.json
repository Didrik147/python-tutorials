    "Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal thank you very much.",
    "They were the last\npeople youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious\nbecause they just didnt hold with such nonsense.",
    "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made\ndrills.",
    "He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did\nhave a very large mustache.",
    "Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the\nneighbors.",
    "The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.",
    "The Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.",
    "They didnt\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.",
    "Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years\nin fact Mrs. Dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her\nsister and her goodfornothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be.",
    "The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street.",
    "The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son too but they had never even seen him.",
    "This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away they didnt want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.",
    "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story\nstarts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry.",
    "Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.",
    "None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.",
    "At half past eight Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls.",
    "Little tyke chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.",
    "He got\ninto his car and backed out of number fours drive.",
    "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar  a cat reading a map.",
    "For a second Mr. Dursley\ndidnt realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to\nlook again.",
    "There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive but there wasnt a map in sight.",
    "What could he have been thinking\nof It must have been a trick of the light.",
    "Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat.",
    "It stared back.",
    "As Mr. Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror.",
    "It was now\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive  no looking at the sign cats\ncouldnt read maps or signs.",
    "Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\nput the cat out of his mind.",
    "As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.",
    "But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse.",
    "As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout.",
    "People in cloaks.",
    "Mr. Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes  the getups you saw on young people He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion.",
    "He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by.",
    "They were whispering excitedly together.",
    "Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man\nhad to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak The\nnerve of him But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes that would be it.",
    "The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr.\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills.",
    "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\nninth floor.",
    "If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate\non drills that morning.",
    "He didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad\ndaylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed\nopen mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.",
    "Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime.",
    "Mr. Dursley however had a perfectly\nnormal owlfree morning.",
    "He yelled at five different people.",
    "He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.",
    "He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.",
    "Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the bakers.",
    "He eyed them angrily as he passed.",
    "He didnt\nknow why but they made him uneasy.",
    "This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin.",
    "It was on\nhis way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.",
    "The Potters thats right thats what I heard yes their son Harry\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead.",
    "Fear flooded him.",
    "He looked back at the\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better\nof it.",
    "He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his\nsecretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.",
    "He put the\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking... no he was\nbeing stupid.",
    "Potter wasnt such an unusual name.",
    "He was sure there were\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.",
    "Come to think\nof it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called Harry.",
    "Hed never even\nseen the boy.",
    "It might have been Harvey.",
    "Or Harold.",
    "There was no point\nin worrying Mrs. Dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her\nsister.",
    "He didnt blame her  if hed had a sister like that... but all\nthe same those people in cloaks...",
    "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\nwhen he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.",
    "Sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.",
    "It\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\nviolet cloak.",
    "He didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\nground.",
    "On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare Dont be sorry my dear sir\nfor nothing could upset me today Rejoice for YouKnowWho has gone at\nlast Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy\nhappy day\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.",
    "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.",
    "He had been hugged by a complete\nstranger.",
    "He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that\nwas.",
    "He was rattled.",
    "He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping\nhe was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he\ndidnt approve of imagination.",
    "As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw \nand it didnt improve his mood  was the tabby cat hed spotted that\nmorning.",
    "It was now sitting on his garden wall.",
    "He was sure it was the\nsame one it had the same markings around its eyes.",
    "Shoo said Mr. Dursley loudly.",
    "The cat didnt move.",
    "It just gave him a\nstern look.",
    "Was this normal cat behavior Mr. Dursley wondered.",
    "Trying\nto pull himself together he let himself into the house.",
    "He was still\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife.",
    "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice normal day.",
    "She told him over dinner all\nabout Mrs. Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\nlearned a new word Wont.",
    "Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.",
    "When\nDudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to\ncatch the last report on the evening news\n\nAnd finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations\nowls have been behaving very unusually today.",
    "Although owls normally\nhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been\nhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\nsunrise.",
    "Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\nchanged their sleeping pattern.",
    "The newscaster allowed himself a grin.",
    "Most mysterious.",
    "And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.",
    "Going\nto be any more showers of owls tonight Jim\n\nWell Ted said the weatherman I dont know about that but its not\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today.",
    "Viewers as far apart as\nKent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\nof the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting\nstars Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early  its\nnot until next week folks But I can promise a wet night tonight.",
    "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.",
    "Shooting stars all over Britain\nOwls flying by daylight Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place\nAnd a whisper a whisper about the Potters...\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.",
    "It was\nno good.",
    "Hed have to say something to her.",
    "He cleared his throat\nnervously.",
    "Er  Petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister\nlately have you\n\nAs he had expected Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry.",
    "After all\nthey normally pretended she didnt have a sister.",
    "No she said sharply.",
    "Why\n\nFunny stuff on the news Mr. Dursley mumbled.",
    "Owls... shooting\nstars... and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today...",
    "So snapped Mrs. Dursley.",
    "Well I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\nknow... her crowd.",
    "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.",
    "Mr. Dursley wondered\nwhether he dared tell her hed heard the name Potter.",
    "He decided he\ndidnt dare.",
    "Instead he said as casually as he could Their son \nhed be about Dudleys age now wouldnt he\n\nI suppose so said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.",
    "Whats his name again Howard isnt it\n\nHarry.",
    "Nasty common name if you ask me.",
    "Oh yes said Mr. Dursley his heart sinking horribly.",
    "Yes I quite\nagree.",
    "He didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.",
    "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\nwindow and peered down into the front garden.",
    "The cat was still there.",
    "It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\nsomething.",
    "Was he imagining things Could all this have anything to do with the\nPotters If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of\n well he didnt think he could bear it.",
    "The Dursleys got into bed.",
    "Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\nDursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind.",
    "His last comforting\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\ninvolved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\nDursley.",
    "The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind....",
    "He couldnt see how he and Petunia could get\nmixed up in anything that might be going on  he yawned and turned over\n it couldnt affect them....\n\nHow very wrong he was.",
    "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.",
    "It was sitting as\nstill as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive.",
    "It didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the\nnext street nor when two owls swooped overhead.",
    "In fact it was nearly\nmidnight before the cat moved at all.",
    "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so\nsuddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the\nground.",
    "The cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.",
    "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.",
    "He was tall\nthin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt.",
    "He was wearing long robes\na purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots.",
    "His blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon\nspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been\nbroken at least twice.",
    "This mans name was Albus Dumbledore.",
    "Albus Dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.",
    "He was\nbusy rummaging in his cloak looking for something.",
    "But he did seem to\nrealize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat\nwhich was still staring at him from the other end of the street.",
    "For\nsome reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.",
    "He chuckled and\nmuttered I should have known.",
    "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.",
    "It seemed to be a\nsilver cigarette lighter.",
    "He flicked it open held it up in the air and\nclicked it.",
    "The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.",
    "He\nclicked it again  the next lamp flickered into darkness.",
    "Twelve times\nhe clicked the PutOuter until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat\nwatching him.",
    "If anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed\nMrs. Dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement.",
    "Dumbledore slipped the PutOuter back inside his\ncloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down\non the wall next to the cat.",
    "He didnt look at it but after a moment he\nspoke to it.",
    "Fancy seeing you here Professor McGonagall.",
    "He turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone.",
    "Instead he was smiling\nat a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.",
    "She too was\nwearing a cloak an emerald one.",
    "Her black hair was drawn into a tight\nbun.",
    "She looked distinctly ruffled.",
    "How did you know it was me she asked.",
    "My dear Professor I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.",
    "Youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said\nProfessor McGonagall.",
    "All day When you could have been celebrating I must have passed a\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.",
    "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.",
    "Oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently.",
    "Youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no  even the Muggles\nhave noticed somethings going on.",
    "It was on their news.",
    "She jerked her\nhead back at the Dursleys dark livingroom window.",
    "I heard it.",
    "Flocks\nof owls... shooting stars.... Well theyre not completely stupid.",
    "They\nwere bound to notice something.",
    "Shooting stars down in Kent  Ill bet\nthat was Dedalus Diggle.",
    "He never had much sense.",
    "You cant blame them said Dumbledore gently.",
    "Weve had precious\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.",
    "I know that said Professor McGonagall irritably.",
    "But thats no\nreason to lose our heads.",
    "People are being downright careless out on\nthe streets in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle clothes\nswapping rumors.",
    "She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping\nhe was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on.",
    "A\nfine thing it would be if on the very day YouKnowWho seems to have\ndisappeared at last the Muggles found out about us all.",
    "I suppose he\nreally has gone Dumbledore\n\nIt certainly seems so said Dumbledore.",
    "We have much to be thankful\nfor.",
    "Would you care for a lemon drop\n\nA what\n\nA lemon drop.",
    "Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of\n\nNo thank you said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she didnt\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops.",
    "As I say even if\nYouKnowWho has gone \n\nMy dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\nby his name All this You KnowWho nonsense  for eleven years I\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name\nVoldemort.",
    "Professor McGonagall flinched but Dumbledore who was\nunsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice.",
    "It all gets so\nconfusing if we keep saying YouKnowWho.",
    "I have never seen any reason\nto be frightened of saying Voldemorts name.",
    "I know you haven t said Professor McGonagall sounding half\nexasperated half admiring.",
    "But youre different.",
    "Everyone knows youre\nthe only one YouKnow oh all right Voldemort was frightened of.",
    "You flatter me said Dumbledore calmly.",
    "Voldemort had powers I will\nnever have.",
    "Only because youre too  well  noble to use them.",
    "Its lucky its dark.",
    "I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.",
    "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said The owls\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.",
    "You know what\neveryones saying About why hes disappeared About what finally\nstopped him\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\nanxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard\nwall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed\nDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.",
    "It was plain that\nwhatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until\nDumbledore told her it was true.",
    "Dumbledore however was choosing\nanother lemon drop and did not answer.",
    "What theyre saying she pressed on is that last night Voldemort\nturned up in Godrics Hollow.",
    "He went to find the Potters.",
    "The rumor is\nthat Lily and James Potter are  are  that theyre  dead.",
    "Dumbledore bowed his head.",
    "Professor McGonagall gasped.",
    "Lily and James...",
    "I cant believe it...",
    "I didnt want to believe it...\nOh Albus...\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.",
    "I know...",
    "I\nknow... he said heavily.",
    "Professor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on.",
    "Thats not all.",
    "Theyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry.",
    "But  he\ncouldnt.",
    "He couldnt kill that little boy.",
    "No one knows why or how\nbut theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter Voldemorts\npower somehow broke  and thats why hes gone.",
    "Dumbledore nodded glumly.",
    "Its  its true faltered Professor McGonagall.",
    "After all hes\ndone... all the people hes killed... he couldnt kill a little boy\nIts just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive\n\nWe can only guess said Dumbledore.",
    "We may never know.",
    "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\neyes beneath her spectacles.",
    "Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it.",
    "It was a very odd watch.",
    "It had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving\naround the edge.",
    "It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because\nhe put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late.",
    "I suppose it was\nhe who told you Id be here by the way\n\nYes said Professor McGonagall.",
    "And I dont suppose youre going to\ntell me why youre here of all places\n\nIve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.",
    "Theyre the only family\nhe has left now.",
    "You dont mean  you cant mean the people who live here cried\nProfessor McGonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.",
    "Dumbledore  you cant.",
    "Ive been watching them all day.",
    "You couldnt\nfind two people who are less like us.",
    "And theyve got this son  I saw\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets.",
    "Harry Potter come and live here\n\nIts the best place for him said Dumbledore firmly.",
    "His aunt and\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older.",
    "Ive\nwritten them a letter.",
    "A letter repeated Professor McGonagall faintly sitting back down on\nthe wall.",
    "Really Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a\nletter These people will never understand him Hell be famous  a\nlegend  I wouldnt be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\nin the future  there will be books written about Harry  every child\nin our world will know his name\n\nExactly said Dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his\nhalfmoon glasses.",
    "It would be enough to turn any boys head.",
    "Famous\nbefore he can walk and talk Famous for something he wont even\nremember CarA you see how much better off hell be growing up away\nfrom all that until hes ready to take it\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and\nthen said Yes  yes youre right of course.",
    "But how is the boy\ngetting here Dumbledore She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she\nthought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.",
    "Hagrids bringing him.",
    "You think it  wise  to trust Hagrid with something as important as\nthis\n\nI would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore.",
    "Im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless.",
    "He does\ntend to  what was that\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.",
    "It grew\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\nheadlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  and\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of\nthem.",
    "If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride\nit.",
    "He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\nas wide.",
    "He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild  long\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands\nthe size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were\nlike baby dolphins.",
    "In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle\nof blankets.",
    "Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved.",
    "At last.",
    "And where did\nyou get that motorcycle\n\nBorrowed it Professor Dumbledore sit said the giant climbing\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.",
    "Young Sirius Black lent it to\nme.",
    "Ive got him sir.",
    "No problems were there\n\nNo sir  house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin around.",
    "He fell asleep as we was\nflyin over Bristol.",
    "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\nblankets.",
    "Inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep.",
    "Under a\ntuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously\nshaped cut like a bolt of lightning.",
    "Is that where  whispered Professor McGonagall.",
    "Yes said Dumbledore.",
    "Hell have that scar forever.",
    "Couldnt you do something about it Dumbledore\n\nEven if I could I wouldnt.",
    "Scars can come in handy.",
    "I have one myself\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.",
    "Well\n give him here Hagrid  wed better get this over with.",
    "Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house.",
    "Could I  could I say goodbye to him sir asked Hagrid.",
    "He bent his\ngreat shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\nscratchy whiskery kiss.",
    "Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a\nwounded dog.",
    "Shhh hissed Professor McGonagall youll wake the Muggles\n\nSssorry sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and\nburying his face in it.",
    "But I cccant stand it  Lily an James dead\n an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \n\nYes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or\nwell be found Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\nthe front door.",
    "He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out\nof his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to\nthe other two.",
    "For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at\nthe little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall\nblinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from\nDumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out.",
    "Well said Dumbledore finally thats that.",
    "Weve no business staying\nhere.",
    "We may as well go and join the celebrations.",
    "Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Ill be takin Sirius his\nbike back.",
    "Gnight Professor McGonagall  Professor Dumbledore sir.",
    "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose\ninto the air and off into the night.",
    "I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall said Dumbledore\nnodding to her.",
    "Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.",
    "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.",
    "On the corner he\nstopped and took out the silver PutOuter.",
    "He clicked it once and\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking\naround the corner at the other end of the street.",
    "He could just see the\nbundle of blankets on the step of number four.",
    "Good luck Harry he murmured.",
    "He turned on his heel and with a swish\nof his cloak he was gone.",
    "A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and\ntidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect\nastonishing things to happen.",
    "Harry Potter rolled over inside his\nblankets without waking up.",
    "One small hand closed on the letter beside\nhim and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was\nfamous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs.\nDursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\nbottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\npinched by his cousin Dudley...",
    "He couldnt know that at this very\nmoment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices To Harry Potter  the boy\nwho lived\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall.",
    "The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\nnumber four on the Dursleys front door it crept into their living\nroom which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when\nMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.",
    "Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.",
    "Ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets  but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a\ncomputer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother.",
    "The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too.",
    "Yet Harry Potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for\nlong.",
    "His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day.",
    "Up Get up Now\n\nHarry woke with a start.",
    "His aunt rapped on the door again.",

    "He found a pair under his bed and\nafter pulling a spider off one of them put them on.",
    "Harry was used to\nspiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and\nthat was where he slept.",
    "When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.",
    "The table\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudleys birthday presents.",
    "It looked as\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the\nsecond television and the racing bike.",
    "Exactly why Dudley wanted a\nracing bike was a mystery to Harry as Dudley was very fat and hated\nexercise  unless of course it involved punching somebody.",
    "Dudleys\nfavorite punching bag was Harry but he couldnt often catch him.",
    "Harry\ndidnt look it but he was very fast.",
    "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry\nhad always been small and skinny for his age.",

    "He had had it as long as he could\nremember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\nPetunia was how he had gotten it.",
    "In the car crash when your parents died she had said.",
    "And dont ask\nquestions.",
    "Dont ask questions  that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\nDursleys.",
    "Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.",
    "Comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting.",
    "About once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut.",
    "Harry must have had more haircuts\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put\n\ntogether but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way \nall over the place.",
    "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\nmother.",
    "Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.",
    "He had a large pink face\nnot much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay\nsmoothly on his thick fat head.",
    "Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley\nlooked like a baby angel  Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig.",

    "Thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father.",
    "Thats two\nless than last year.",
    "Darling you havent counted Auntie Marges present see its here\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy.",
    "All right thirtyseven then said Dudley going red in the face.",
    "Harry who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down\nhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.",
    "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly\nAnd well buy you another two presents while were out today.",
    "Hows\nthat popkin Two more presents.",
    "Is that all right\n\nDudley thought for a moment.",
    "It looked like hard work.",
    "Finally he said\nslowly So Ill have thirty ... thirty...\n\nThirtynine sweetums said Aunt Petunia.",
    "Oh.",
    "Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.",
    "All right\nthen.",
    "Uncle Vernon chuckled.",
    "Little tyke wants his moneys worth just like\nhis father.",
    "Atta boy Dudley He ruffled Dudleys hair.",

    "Harry hated it there.",
    "The whole house smelled of cabbage\nand Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever\nowned.",
    "Now what said Aunt Petunia looking furiously at Harry as though hed\nplanned this.",
    "Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\nbroken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles Snowy Mr. Paws and\nTufty again.",
    "We could phone Marge Uncle Vernon suggested.",
    "Dont be silly Vernon she hates the boy.",
    "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this as though he wasnt\nthere  or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt\nunderstand them like a slug.",
    "What about whatshername your friend  Yvonne\n\nOn vacation in Majorca snapped Aunt Petunia.",
    "You could just leave me here Harry put in hopefully hed be able to\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\non Dudleys computer.",
    "Aunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon.",
    "And come back and find the house in ruins she snarled.",
    "I wont blow up the house said Harry but they werent listening.",
    "I suppose we could take him to the zoo said Aunt Petunia slowly ...\nand leave him in the car....\n\nThat cars new hes not sitting in it alone....\n\nDudley began to cry loudly.",
    "In fact he wasnt really crying  it had\nbeen years since hed really cried  but he knew that if he screwed up\nhis face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted.",
    "Dinky Duddydums dont cry Mummy wont let him spoil your special\nday she cried flinging her arms around him.",
    "I... dont... want... him... ttto come Dudley yelled between huge\npretend sobs.",
    "He always sp spoils everything He shot Harry a nasty\ngrin through the gap in his mothers arms.",

    "Half an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in\nthe back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the\nzoo for the first time in his life.",
    "His aunt and uncle hadnt been able\nto think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left Uncle\nVernon had taken Harry aside.",
    "Im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up\nclose to Harrys Im warning you now boy  any funny business\nanything at all  and youll be in that cupboard from now until\nChristmas.",
    "Im not going to do anything said Harry honestly..",
    "But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him.",
    "No one ever did.",
    "The problem was strange things often happened around Harry and it was\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen.",
    "Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\nas though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which\nshe left to hide that horrible scar.",
    "Dudley had laughed himself silly\nat Harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day\nwhere he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.",
    "Next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it\nhad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week\nin his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he\ncouldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly.",
    "Another time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\nold sweater of Dudleys brown with orange puff balls  The harder she\ntried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit\nHarry.",
    "Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to\nhis great relief Harry wasnt punished.",
    "On the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\nthe roof of the school kitchens.",
    "Dudleys gang had been chasing him as\nusual when as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was\nsitting on the chimney.",
    "The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\nfrom Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings.",
    "But all hed tried to do as he shouted at Uncle Vernon\nthrough the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash\ncans outside the kitchen doors.",
    "Harry supposed that the wind must have\ncaught him in mid jump.",
    "But today nothing was going to go wrong.",
    "It was even worth being with\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school\nhis cupboard or Mrs. Figgs cabbagesmelling living room.",
    "While he drove Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.",
    "He liked to\ncomplain about things people at work Harry the council Harry the\nbank and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.",

    "I know they dont said Harry.",
    "It was only a dream.",
    "But he wished he hadnt said anything.",
    "If there was one thing the\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a\ndream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he might get dangerous\nideas.",
    "It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.",
    "The\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\nentrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap\nlemon ice pop.",
    "It wasnt bad either Harry thought licking it as they\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley\nexcept that it wasnt blond.",
    "Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time.",
    "He was careful to\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who\nwere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall\nback on their favorite hobby of hitting him.",
    "They ate in the zoo\nrestaurant and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\nglory didnt have enough ice cream on top Uncle Vernon bought him\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.",
    "Harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to\nlast.",
    "After lunch they went to the reptile house.",
    "It was cool and dark in\nthere with lit windows all along the walls.",
    "Behind the glass all sorts\nof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\nstone.",
    "Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick\nmancrushing pythons.",
    "Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\nplace.",
    "It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car\nand crushed it into a trash can  but at the moment it didnt look in\nthe mood.",
    "In fact it was fast asleep.",
    "Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the\nglistening brown coils.",
    "Make it move he whined at his father.",
    "Uncle Vernon tapped on the\nglass but the snake didnt budge.",
    "Do it again Dudley ordered.",
    "Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\nwith his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on.",
    "This is boring Dudley moaned.",
    "He shuffled away.",
    "Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.",
    "He\nwouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself  no\ncompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying\nto disturb it all day long.",
    "It was worse than having a cupboard as a\nbedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\nto wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house.",
    "The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes.",
    "Slowly very slowly it raised\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys.",
    "It winked.",
    "Harry stared.",
    "Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\nwatching.",
    "They werent.",
    "He looked back at the snake and winked too.",
    "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley then raised\nits eyes to the ceiling.",
    "It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly\n\nI get that all the time.",
    "I know Harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the\nsnake could hear him.",
    "It must be really annoying.",
    "The snake nodded vigorously.",
    "Where do you come from anyway Harry asked.",
    "The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.",
    "Harry\npeered at it.",
    "Boa Constrictor Brazil.",
    "Was it nice there\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo.",
    "Oh I see  so youve never been to\nBrazil\n\nAs the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\nthem jump.",
    "DUDLEY MR. DURSLEY COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE YOU WONT BELIEVE\nWHAT ITS DOING\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.",
    "Out of the way you he said punching Harry in the ribs.",
    "Caught by\nsurprise Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.",
    "What came next happened\nso fast no one saw how it happened  one second Piers and Dudley were\nleaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with\nhowls of horror.",
    "Harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank\nhad vanished.",
    "The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering\nout onto the floor.",
    "People throughout the reptile house screamed and\nstarted running for the exits.",
    "As the snake slid swiftly past him Harry could have sworn a low\nhissing voice said Brazil here I come.... Thanksss amigo.",
    "The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.",
    "But the glass he kept saying where did the glass go\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea\nwhile he apologized over and over again.",
    "Piers and Dudley could only\ngibber.",
    "As far as Harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernons car Dudley was telling them how it had\nnearly bitten off his leg while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death.",
    "But worst of all for Harry at least was Piers\ncalming down enough to say Harry was talking to it werent you\nHarry\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\nstarting on Harry.",
    "He was so angry he could hardly speak.",
    "He managed to\nsay Go  cupboard  stay  no meals before he collapsed into a\nchair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.",
    "Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch.",
    "He\ndidnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the Dursleys were\nasleep yet.",
    "Until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen\nfor some food.",
    "Hed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as\nlong as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents\nhad died in that car crash.",
    "He couldnt remember being in the car when\nhis parents had died.",
    "Sometimes when he strained his memory during long\nhours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding\nflash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead.",

    "A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word.",
    "The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look.",
    "At school Harry had no one.",
    "Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang.",
    "CHAPTER THREE\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\nlongestever punishment.",

    "True I havent introduced meself.",
    "Rubeus Hagrid Keeper of Keys and\nGrounds at Hogwarts.",
    "He held out an enormous hand and shook Harrys whole arm.",
    "What about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together.",
    "Id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind.",
    "His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and\nhe snorted.",
    "He bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he\nwas doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire\nthere.",
    "It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt\nthe warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath.",
    "The giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a\ncopper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several\nchipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\nbefore starting to make tea.",
    "Soon the hut was full of the sound and\nsmell of sizzling sausage.",
    "Nobody said a thing while the giant was\nworking but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt\nsausages from the poker Dudley fidgeted a little.",
    "Uncle Vernon said\nsharply Dont touch anything he gives you Dudley.",
    "The giant chuckled darkly.",
    "Yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore Dursley don\nworry.",
    "He passed the sausages to Harry who was so hungry he had never tasted\nanything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the\ngiant.",
    "Finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said\nIm sorry but I still dont really know who you are.",

    "He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were\nclenched.",
    "Now you listen here boy he snarled I accept theres something\nstrange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured\n and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no\ndenying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion \nasked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types \njust what I expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end \n\nBut at that moment Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\numbrella from inside his coat.",
    "Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a\nsword he said Im warning you Dursley Im warning you  one more\nword...",
    "In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant\nUncle Vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the\nwall and fell silent.",
    "Thats better said Hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on\nthe sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor.",
    "Harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them.",
    "But what happened to Vol sorry  I mean YouKnowWho\n\nGood question Harry.",

    "Cause somethin about you finished him Harry.",
    "There was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on  I dunno\nwhat it was no one does  but somethin about you stumped him all\nright.",
    "Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but\nHarry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had\nbeen a horrible mistake.",
    "A wizard Him How could he possibly be Hed\nspent his life being clouted by Dudley and bullied by Aunt Petunia and\nUncle Vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned\ninto warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard If\nhed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come Dudley\nhad always been able to kick him around like a football\n\nHagrid he said quietly I think you must have made a mistake.",
    "I\ndont think I can be a wizard.",
    "To his surprise Hagrid chuckled.",
    "Not a wizard eh Never made things happen when you was scared or\nangry\n\nHarry looked into the fire.",
    "Now he came to think about it... every odd\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had\nhappened when he Harry had been upset or angry... chased by Dudleys\ngang he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going\nto school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow\nback... and the very last time Dudley had hit him hadnt he got his\nrevenge without even realizing he was doing it Hadnt he set a boa\nconstrictor on him\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid smiling and saw that Hagrid was positively\nbeaming at him.",
    "See said Hagrid.",
    "Harry Potter not a wizard  you wait youll be\nright famous at Hogwarts.",
    "But Uncle Vernon wasnt going to give in without a fight.",

    "When he turned\nhis back on them Harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in\nhis trousers.",

    "Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all Harry had to do\nwas keep close behind him.",
    "They passed book shops and music stores\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it\ncould sell you a magic wand.",
    "This was just an ordinary street full of\nordinary people.",
    "Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\nbeneath them Were there really shops that sold spell books and\nbroomsticks Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had\ncooked up If Harry hadnt known that the Dursleys had no sense of\nhumor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything\nHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable Harry couldnt help\ntrusting him.",

    "Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldnt see the Leaky Cauldron at\nall.",
    "In fact Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it.",
    "Before he could mention this Hagrid had steered\nhim inside.",
    "For a famous place it was very dark and shabby.",
    "A few old women were\nsitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry.",
    "One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe.",
    "A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\nbartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.",
    "The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in.",
    "Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a\nglass saying The usual Hagrid\n\nCant Tom Im on Hogwarts business said Hagrid clapping his great\nhand on Harrys shoulder and making Harrys knees buckle.",

    "Welcome back Mr. Potter welcome back.",
    "Harry didnt know what to say.",
    "Everyone was looking at him.",
    "The old\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.",
    "Hagrid was beaming.",
    "Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment Harry\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.",
    "Doris Crockford Mr. Potter cant believe Im meeting you at last.",

    "Youll be ggetting all your\nequipment I suppose Ive ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires\nmmyself.",
    "He looked terrified at the very thought.",
    "But the others wouldnt let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.",
    "It\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all.",
    "At last Hagrid\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble.",
    "Must get on  lots ter buy.",
    "Come on Harry.",
    "Doris Crockford shook Harrys hand one last time and Hagrid led them\nthrough the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was\nnothing but a trash can and a few weeds.",
    "Hagrid grinned at Harry.",
    "Told yeh didnt I Told yeh you was famous.",

    "Scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me\numbrella\n\nVampires Hags Harrys head was swimming.",
    "Hagrid meanwhile was\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.",
    "Three up... two across he muttered.",
    "Right stand back Harry.",
    "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.",
    "The brick he had touched quivered  it wriggled  in the middle a\nsmall hole appeared  it grew wider and wider  a second later they\nwere facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid an archway onto a\ncobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.",
    "Welcome said Hagrid to Diagon Alley.",
    "He grinned at Harrys amazement.",
    "They stepped through the archway.",
    "Harry\nlooked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\nback into solid wall.",
    "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.",
    "Cauldrons  All Sizes  Copper Brass Pewter Silver  SelfStirring\n Collapsible said a sign hanging over them.",
    "Yeah youll be needin one said Hagrid but we gotta get yer money\nfirst.",
    "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes.",
    "He turned his head in every\ndirection as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at\nonce the shops the things outside them the people doing their\nshopping.",
    "A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as\nthey passed saying Dragon liver seventeen Sickles an ounce theyre\nmad....\n\nA low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl\nEmporium  Tawny Screech Barn Brown and Snowy.",
    "Several boys of\nabout Harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with\nbroomsticks in it.",
    "Look Harry heard one of them say the new Nimbus\nTwo Thousand  fastest ever  There were shops selling robes shops\nselling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen\nbefore windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes\ntottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion\nbottles globes of the moon....\n\nGringotts said Hagrid.",
    "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\nlittle shops.",
    "Standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a\nuniform of scarlet and gold was \n\nYeah thats a goblin said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\nstone steps toward him.",
    "The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.",
    "He had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and Harry noticed very\nlong fingers and feet.",
    "He bowed as they walked inside.",
    "Now they were\nfacing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved\nupon them\n\nEnter stranger but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed\n\nFor those who take but do not earn\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.",
    "So if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours\n\nThief you have been warned beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.",
    "Like I said Yehd be mad ter try an rob it said Hagrid.",
    "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\nvast marble hall.",
    "About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high\nstools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing\ncoins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses.",
    "There were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more\ngoblins were showing people in and out of these.",
    "Hagrid and Harry made\nfor the counter.",
    "Morning said Hagrid to a free goblin.",
    "Weve come ter take some money\noutta Mr. Harry Potters safe.",
    "You have his key Sir\n\nGot it here somewhere said Hagrid and he started emptying his\npockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\nover the goblins book of numbers.",
    "The goblin wrinkled his nose.",
    "Harry\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as\nglowing coals.",
    "Got it said Hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key.",
    "The goblin looked at it closely.",
    "That seems to be in order.",
    "An Ive also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore said Hagrid\nimportantly throwing out his chest.",
    "Its about the YouKnowWhat in\nvault seven hundred and thirteen.",
    "The goblin read the letter carefully.",
    "Very well he said handing it back to Hagrid I will have Someone\ntake you down to both vaults.",
    "Griphook\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin.",
    "Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\nbiscuits back inside his pockets he and Harry followed Griphook toward\none of the doors leading off the hall.",
    "Whats the YouKnowWhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen Harry\nasked.",
    "Cant tell yeh that said Hagrid mysteriously.",
    "Very secret.",
    "Hogwarts\nbusiness.",
    "Dumbledores trusted me.",
    "Moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh\nthat.",
    "Griphook held the door open for them.",
    "Harry who had expected more\nmarble was surprised.",
    "They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with\nflaming torches.",
    "It sloped steeply downward and there were little\nrailway tracks on the floor.",
    "Griphook whistled and a small cart came\nhurtling up the tracks toward them.",
    "They climbed in  Hagrid with some\ndifficulty  and were off.",
    "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.",
    "Harry\ntried to remember left right right left middle fork right left\nbut it was impossible.",
    "The rattling cart seemed to know its own way\nbecause Griphook wasnt steering.",
    "Harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them\nwide open.",
    "Once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a\npassage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late  \nthey plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge\nstalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.",
    "I never know Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart\nwhats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite\n\nStalagmites got an m in it said Hagrid.",
    "An don ask me questions\njust now I think Im gonna be sick.",
    "He did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\ndoor in the passage wall Hagrid got out and had to lean against the\nwall to stop his knees from trembling.",
    "Griphook unlocked the door.",
    "A lot of green smoke came billowing out and\nas it cleared Harry gasped.",
    "Inside were mounds of gold coins.",
    "Columns\nof silver.",
    "Heaps of little bronze Knuts.",
    "All yours smiled Hagrid.",
    "All Harrys  it was incredible.",
    "The Dursleys couldnt have known about\nthis or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking.",
    "How often had\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep And all the time there\nhad been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under London.",
    "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.",
    "The gold ones are Galleons he explained.",
    "Seventeen silver Sickles to\na Galleon and twentynine Knuts to a Sickle its easy enough.",
    "Right\nthat should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe\nfor yeh.",
    "He turned to Griphook.",
    "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now\nplease and can we go more slowly\n\nOne speed only said Griphook.",
    "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed.",
    "The air became\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.",
    "They went\nrattling over an underground ravine and Harry leaned over the side to\ntry to see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and\npulled him back by the scruff of his neck.",
    "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.",
    "Stand back said Griphook importantly.",
    "He stroked the door gently with\none of his long fingers and it simply melted away.",
    "If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through\nthe door and trapped in there said Griphook.",
    "How often do you check to see if anyones inside Harry asked.",
    "About once every ten years said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.",
    "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault\nHarry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous\njewels at the very least  but at first he thought it was empty.",
    "Then\nhe noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on\nthe floor.",
    "Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.",
    "Harry\nlonged to know what it was but knew better than to ask.",
    "Come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way\nback its best if I keep me mouth shut said Hagrid.",
    "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\nGringotts.",
    "Harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag\nfull of money.",
    "He didnt have to know how many Galleons there were to a\npound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole\nlife  more money than even Dudley had ever had.",
    "Might as well get yer uniform said Hagrid nodding toward Madam\nMalkins Robes for All Occasions.",
    "Listen Harry would yeh mind if I\nslipped off fer a pickmeup in the Leaky Cauldron I hate them\nGringotts carts.",
    "He did still look a bit sick so Harry entered Madam\nMalkins shop alone feeling nervous.",
    "Madam Malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve.",
    "Hogwarts clear she said when Harry started to speak.",
    "Got the lot\nhere  another young man being fitted up just now in fact.",
    "In the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on\na footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.",
    "Madam\nMalkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his\nhead and began to pin it to the right length.",
    "Hello said the boy Hogwarts too\n\nYes said Harry.",
    "My fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street\nlooking at wands said the boy.",
    "He had a bored drawling voice.",
    "Then\nIm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms.",
    "I dont see why\nfirst years cant have their own.",
    "I think Ill bully father into getting\nme one and Ill smuggle it in somehow.",
    "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.",
    "Have you got your own broom the boy went on.",
    "No said Harry.",
    "Play Quidditch at all\n\nNo Harry said again wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.",
    "I do  Father says its a crime if Im not picked to play for my\nhouse and I must say I agree.",
    "Know what house youll be in yet\n\nNo said Harry feeling more stupid by the minute.",
    "Well no one really knows until they get there do they but I know\nIll be in Slytherin all our family have been  imagine being in\nHufflepuff I think Id leave wouldnt you Mmm said Harry wishing\nhe could say something a bit more interesting.",
    "I say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the\nfront window.",
    "Hagrid was standing there grinning at Harry and pointing\nat two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in.",
    "Thats Hagrid said Harry pleased to know something the boy didnt.",
    "He works at Hogwarts.",
    "Oh said the boy Ive heard of him.",
    "Hes a sort of servant isnt\nhe\n\nHes the gamekeeper said Harry.",
    "He was liking the boy less and less\nevery second.",
    "Yes exactly.",
    "I heard hes a sort of savage  lives in a hut on the\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic\nand ends up setting fire to his bed.",
    "I think hes brilliant said Harry coldly.",
    "Do you said the boy with a slight sneer.",
    "Why is he with you Where\nare your parents\n\nTheyre dead said Harry shortly.",
    "He didnt feel much like going into\nthe matter with this boy.",
    "Oh sorry said the other.",
    "not sounding sorry at all.",
    "But they were\nour kind werent they\n\nThey were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean.",
    "I really dont think they should let the other sort in do you Theyre\njust not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways.",
    "Some\nof them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter\nimagine.",
    "I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.",
    "Whats your surname anyway\n\nBut before Harry could answer Madam Malkin said Thats you done my\ndear and Harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy\nhopped down from the footstool.",
    "Well Ill see you at Hogwarts I suppose said the drawling boy.",
    "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\nchocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts.",
    "Whats up said Hagrid.",
    "Nothing Harry lied.",
    "They stopped to buy parchment and quills.",
    "Harry\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\nwrote.",
    "When they had left the shop he said Hagrid whats Quidditch\n\nBlimey Harry I keep forgettin how little yeh know  not knowin\nabout Quidditch\n\nDont make me feel worse said Harry.",
    "He told Hagrid about the pate\nboy in Madam Malkins.",

    "And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff\n\nSchool houses.",
    "Theres four.",
    "Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\nduffers but \n\nI bet Im in Hufflepuff said Harry gloomily.",

    "Theres not a\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.",
    "YouKnowWho was one.",
    "Vol sorry  YouKnowWho was at Hogwarts\n\nYears an years ago said Hagrid.",
    "They bought Harrys school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as\npaving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\nnothing in them at all.",
    "Even Dudley who never read anything would have\nbeen wild to get his hands on some of these.",
    "Hagrid almost had to drag\nHarry away from Curses and Countercurses Bewitch Your Friends and\nBefuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges Hair Loss JellyLegs\nTongue Tying and Much Much More by Professor Vindictus Viridian.",
    "I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.",
    "Im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances said Hagrid.",
    "An\nanyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more\nstudy before yeh get ter that level.",
    "Hagrid wouldnt let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron either It says\npewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing\npotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.",
    "Then they visited\nthe Apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible\nsmell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages.",
    "Barrels of slimy stuff\nstood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined\nthe walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung\nfrom the ceiling.",
    "While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry Harry himself\nexamined silver unicorn horns at twentyone Galleons each and minuscule\nglitteryblack beetle eyes five Knuts a scoop.",

    "Harry now\ncarried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with\nher head under her wing.",
    "He couldnt stop stammering his thanks\nsounding just like Professor Quirrell.",
    "Don mention it said Hagrid gruffly.",
    "Don expect youve had a lotta\npresents from them Dursleys.",
    "Just Ollivanders left now  only place fer\nwands Ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand.",
    "A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.",
    "The last shop was narrow and shabby.",
    "Peeling gold letters over the door\nread Ollivanders Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.",
    "A single wand lay\non a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.",
    "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\ninside.",
    "It was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair\nthat Hagrid sat on to wait.",
    "Harry felt strangely as though he had\nentered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that\nhad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow\nboxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.",
    "For some reason the back of\nhis neck prickled.",
    "The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle\nwith some secret magic.",
    "Good afternoon said a soft voice.",
    "Harry jumped.",
    "Hagrid must have\njumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly\noff the spindly chair.",
    "An old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.",
    "Hello said Harry awkwardly.",
    "Ah yes said the man.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "I thought Id be seeing you soon.",
    "Harry Potter.",
    "It wasnt a question.",
    "You have your mothers eyes.",
    "It\nseems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand.",
    "Ten\nand a quarter inches long swishy made of willow.",
    "Nice wand for charm\nwork.",
    "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry.",
    "Harry wished he would blink.",
    "Those\nsilvery eyes were a bit creepy.",
    "Your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand.",
    "Eleven inches.",
    "Pliable.",
    "A little more power and excellent for transfiguration.",
    "Well I\nsay your father favored it  its really the wand that chooses the\nwizard of course.",
    "Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\nnose.",
    "Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.",
    "And thats where...\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harrys forehead with a\nlong white finger.",
    "Im sorry to say I sold the wand that did it he said softly.",
    "Thirteenandahalf inches.",
    "Yew.",
    "Powerful wand very powerful and in\nthe wrong hands... well if Id known what that wand was going out into\nthe world to do....",
    "He shook his head and then to Harrys relief spotted Hagrid.",
    "Rubeus Rubeus Hagrid How nice to see you again.... Oak sixteen\ninches rather bendy wasnt it\n\nIt was sir yes said Hagrid.",
    "Good wand that one.",
    "But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got\nexpelled said Mr. Ollivander suddenly stern.",
    "Er  yes they did yes said Hagrid shuffling his feet.",
    "Ive still\ngot the pieces though he added brightly.",
    "But you dont use them said Mr. Ollivander sharply.",
    "Oh no sit said Hagrid quickly.",
    "Harry noticed he gripped his pink\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.",
    "Hmmm said Mr. Ollivander giving Hagrid a piercing look.",
    "Well now\n Mr. Potter.",
    "Let me see.",
    "He pulled a long tape measure with silver\nmarkings out of his pocket.",
    "Which is your wand arm\n\nEr  well Im righthanded said Harry.",
    "Hold out your arm.",
    "Thats it.",
    "He measured Harry from shoulder to\nfinger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round\nhis head.",
    "As he measured he said Every Ollivander wand has a core of\na powerful magical substance Mr. Potter.",
    "We use unicorn hairs phoenix\ntail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons.",
    "No two Ollivander wands\nare the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite\nthe same.",
    "And of course you will never get such good results with\nanother wizards wand.",
    "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring\nbetween his nostrils was doing this on its own.",
    "Mr. Ollivander was\nflitting around the shelves taking down boxes.",
    "That will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on\nthe floor.",
    "Right then Mr. Potter.",
    "Try this one.",
    "Beechwood and dragon\nheartstring.",
    "Nine inches.",
    "Nice and flexible.",
    "just take it and give it a\nwave.",
    "Harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but Mr.\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.",
    "Maple and phoenix feather.",
    "Seven inches.",
    "Quite whippy.",
    "Try \n\nHarry tried  but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.",
    "No no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy.",
    "Go on go on try it out.",
    "Harry tried.",
    "And tried.",
    "He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\nfor.",
    "The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the\nspindly chair but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the\nshelves the happier he seemed to become.",
    "Tricky customer eh Not to worry well find the perfect match here\nsomewhere  I wonder now   yes why not  unusual combination \nholly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple.",
    "Harry took the wand.",
    "He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.",
    "He raised\nthe wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air\nand a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls.",
    "Hagrid whooped and\nclapped and Mr. Ollivander cried Oh bravo Yes indeed oh very\ngood.",
    "Well well well... how curious... how very curious...",
    "He put Harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper\nstill muttering Curious... curious..",
    "Sorry said Harry but whats curious\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.",
    "I remember every wand Ive ever sold Mr. Potter.",
    "Every single wand.",
    "It\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave\nanother feather  just one other.",
    "It is very curious indeed that you\nshould be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave\nyou that scar.",
    "Harry swallowed.",
    "Yes thirteenandahalf inches.",
    "Yew.",
    "Curious indeed how these things\nhappen.",
    "The wand chooses the wizard remember....",
    "I think we must expect\ngreat things from you Mr. Potter.... After all He\nWhoMustNotBeNamed did great things  terrible yes but great.",
    "Harry shivered.",
    "He wasnt sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.",
    "He paid\nseven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\nshop.",
    "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made\ntheir way back down Diagon Alley back through the wall back through\nthe Leaky Cauldron now empty.",
    "Harry didnt speak at all as they walked\ndown the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at\nthem on the Underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped\npackages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harrys lap.",
    "Up\nanother escalator out into Paddington station Harry only realized\nwhere they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.",
    "Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said.",
    "He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\nthem.",
    "Harry kept looking around.",
    "Everything looked so strange somehow.",
    "You all right Harry Yer very quiet said Hagrid.",
    "Harry wasnt sure he could explain.",
    "Hed just had the best birthday of\nhis life  and yet  he chewed his hamburger trying to find the\nwords.",
    "Everyone thinks Im special he said at last.",
    "All those people in the\nLeaky Cauldron Professor Quirrell Mr. Ollivander... but I dont know\nanything about magic at all.",
    "How can they expect great things Im\nfamous and I cant even remember what Im famous for.",
    "I dont know what\nhappened when Vol sorry  I mean the night my parents died.",
    "Hagrid leaned across the table.",
    "Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\nwore a very kind smile.",
    "Don you worry Harry.",
    "Youll learn fast enough.",
    "Everyone starts at the\nbeginning at Hogwarts youll be just fine.",

    "Any problems with the Dursleys send me a\nletter with yer owl shell know where to find me.... See yeh soon\nHarry.",
    "The train pulled out of the station.",
    "Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until\nhe was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against\nthe window but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.",
    "CHAPTER SIX\n\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREEQUARTERS\n\nHarrys last month with the Dursleys wasnt fun.",
    "True Dudley was now so\nscared of Harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while Aunt Petunia\nand Uncle Vernon didnt shut Harry in his cupboard force him to do\nanything or shout at him  in fact they didnt speak to him at all.",
    "Half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with Harry\nin it were empty.",
    "Although this was an improvement in many ways it did\nbecome a bit depressing after a while.",
    "Harry kept to his room with his new owl for company.",
    "He had decided to\ncall her Hedwig a name he had found in A History of Magic.",
    "His school\nbooks were very interesting.",
    "He lay on his bed reading late into the\nnight Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.",
    "It\nwas lucky that Aunt Petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice.",
    "Every night before he went to\nsleep Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall counting down to September the first.",
    "On the last day of August he thought hed better speak to his aunt and\nuncle about getting to Kings Cross station the next day so he went\ndown to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on\ntelevision.",
    "He cleared his throat to let them know he was there and\nDudley screamed and ran from the room.",
    "Er  Uncle Vernon\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.",
    "Er  I need to be at Kings Cross tomorrow to  to go to Hogwarts.",
    "Uncle Vernon grunted again.",
    "Would it be all right if you gave me a lift\n\nGrunt.",

    "They reached Kings Cross at half past ten.",
    "Uncle Vernon dumped Harrys\ntrunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.",
    "Harry thought\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead facing the\nplatforms with a nasty grin on his face.",
    "Well there you are boy.",
    "Platform nine  platform ten.",
    "Your platform\nshould be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it\nyet do they\n\nHe was quite right of course.",

    "Hed have to ask someone.",
    "He stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and\nthreequarters.",
    "The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry\ncouldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to\nget annoyed as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.",
    "Getting\ndesperate Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but\nthe guard said there wasnt one.",
    "In the end the guard strode away\nmuttering about time wasters.",
    "Harry was now trying hard not to panic.",
    "According to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes\nleft to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly\nlift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl.",
    "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.",
    "He\nwondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket\ninspectors stand between platforms nine and ten.",
    "At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\nfew words of what they were saying.",
    "packed with Muggles of course \n\nHarry swung round.",
    "The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four\nboys all with flaming red hair.",
    "Each of them was pushing a trunk like\nHarrys in front of him  and they had an owl.",
    "Heart hammering Harry pushed his cart after them.",
    "They stopped and so\ndid he just near enough to hear what they were saying.",
    "Now whats the platform number said the boys mother.",
    "Nine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was\nholding her hand Mom cant I go... \n\nYoure not old enough Ginny now be quiet.",
    "All right Percy you go\nfirst.",
    "What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.",
    "Harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it  but just as\nthe boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large\ncrowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last\nbackpack had cleared away the boy had vanished.",
    "Fred you next the plump woman said.",
    "Im not Fred Im George said the boy.",
    "Honestly woman you call\nyourself our mother CarA you tell Im George\n\nSorry George dear.",
    "Only joking I am Fred said the boy and off he went.",
    "His twin called\nafter him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later\nhe had gone  but how had he done it\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\nalmost there  and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere.",
    "There was nothing else for it.",
    "Excuse me Harry said to the plump woman.",
    "Hello dear she said.",
    "First time at Hogwarts Rons new too.",
    "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons.",
    "He was tall thin and\ngangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose.",
    "Yes said Harry.",
    "The thing is  the thing is I dont know how to\n\n\nHow to get onto the platform she said kindly and Harry nodded.",
    "Not to worry she said.",
    "All you have to do is walk straight at the\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten.",
    "Dont stop and dont be scared\nyoull crash into it thats very important.",
    "Best do it at a bit of a\nrun if youre nervous.",
    "Go on go now before Ron.",
    "Er  okay said Harry.",
    "He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier.",
    "It looked very\nsolid.",
    "He started to walk toward it.",
    "People jostled him on their way to\nplatforms nine and ten.",
    "Harry walked more quickly.",
    "He was going to smash\nright into that barrier and then hed be in trouble  leaning forward\non his cart he broke into a heavy run  the barrier was coming nearer\nand nearer  he wouldnt be able to stop  the cart was out of control\n he was a foot away  he closed his eyes ready for the crash \n\nIt didnt come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes.",
    "A scarlet\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.",
    "A sign\noverhead said Hogwarts Express eleven Oclock.",
    "Harry looked behind him\nand saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the\nwords Platform Nine and ThreeQuarters on it He had done it.",
    "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.",
    "Owls\nhooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and\nthe scraping of heavy trunks.",
    "The first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging\nout of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats.",
    "Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.",
    "He passed a roundfaced boy who was saying Gran Ive lost my toad\nagain.",
    "Oh Neville he heard the old woman sigh.",
    "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.",
    "Give us a look Lee go on.",

    "Rons ears went pink.",
    "He seemed to think hed said too much because he\nwent back to staring out of the window.",
    "Harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to\nafford an owl.",
    "After all hed never had any money in his life until a\nmonth ago and he told Ron so all about having to wear Dudleys old\nclothes and never getting proper birthday presents.",
    "This seemed to cheer\nRon up.",
    "... and until Hagrid told me I didnt know anything about be ing a\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\n\nRon gasped.",
    "What said Harry.",

    "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\ncorridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said\nAnything off the cart dears\n\nHarry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but Rons ears\nwent pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches.",
    "Harry went\nout into the corridor.",
    "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys and now that he\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\nMars Bars as he could carry  but the woman didnt have Mars Bars.",

    "But see what the card is.",
    "Im missing Agrippa.",
    "What\n\nOh of course you wouldnt know  Chocolate Frogs have cards inside\nthem you know to collect  famous witches and wizards.",
    "Ive got about\nfive hundred but I havent got Agrippa or Ptolemy.",
    "Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card.",
    "It showed a\nmans face.",
    "He wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and\nflowing silver hair beard and mustache.",
    "Underneath the picture was the\nname Albus Dumbledore.",
    "So this is Dumbledore said Harry.",
    "Dont tell me youd never heard of Dumbledore said Ron.",
    "Can I have a\nfrog I might get Agrippa  thanks\n\nHarry turned over his card and read\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times Dumbledore is\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in\n1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel.",

    "No Ive got Morgana again and Ive got about six of her... do you\nwant it You can start collecting.",
    "Rons eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\nunwrapped.",
    "Help yourself said Harry.",
    "But in you know the Muggle world people\njust stay put in photos.",
    "Do they What they dont move at all Ron sounded amazed.",
    "weird\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\ngave him a small smile.",
    "Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than\nlooking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards but Harry couldnt keep\nhis eyes off them.",
    "Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana but\nHengist of Woodcroft Alberic Grunnion Circe Paracelsus and Merlin.",
    "He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna who was\nscratching her nose to open a bag of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans.",
    "You want to be careful with those Ron warned Harry.",
    "When they say\nevery flavor they mean every flavor  you know you get all the\nordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe.",

    "Im Ron Weasley Ron muttered.",
    "Harry Potter said Harry.",
    "Are you really said Hermione.",
    "I know all about you of course  I\ngot a few extra books.",

    "He flopped back into his seat looking depressed.",
    "You know I think the ends of Scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter\nsaid Harry trying to take Rons mind off houses.",
    "So what do your\noldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school.",
    "Charlies in Romania studying dragons and Bills in Africa doing\nsomething for Gringotts said Ron.",

    "Course\neveryone gets scared when something like this happens in case\nYouKnowWhos behind it.",
    "Harry turned this news over in his mind.",
    "He was starting to get a\nprickle of fear every time You KnowWho was mentioned.",
    "He supposed this\nwas all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more\ncomfortable saying Voldemort without worrying.",
    "Whats your Quidditch team Ron asked.",
    "Er  I dont know any Harry confessed.",
    "What Ron looked dumbfounded.",
    "Oh you wait its the best game in the\nworld  And he was off explaining all about the four balls and the\npositions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to\nwith his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the\nmoney.",
    "He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\nwhen the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt Neville the\ntoadless boy or Hermione Granger this time.",
    "Three boys entered and Harry recognized the middle one at once it was\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkins robe shop.",
    "He was looking at Harry with\na lot more interest than hed shown back in Diagon Alley.",
    "Is it true he said.",
    "Theyre saying all down the train that Harry\nPotters in this compartment.",
    "So its you is it\n\nYes said Harry.",
    "He was looking at the other boys.",
    "Both of them were\nthickset and looked extremely mean.",
    "Standing on either side of the pale\nboy they looked like bodyguards.",
    "Oh this is Crabbe and this is Goyle said the pale boy carelessly\nnoticing where Harry was looking.",
    "And my names Malfoy Draco Malfoy.",
    "Ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget.",
    "Draco\nMalfoy looked at him.",
    "Think my names funny do you No need to ask who you are.",
    "My father\ntold me all the Weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than\nthey can afford.",
    "He turned back to Harry.",
    "Youll soon find out some wizarding families\nare much better than others Potter.",
    "You dont want to go making friends\nwith the wrong sort.",
    "I can help you there.",
    "He held out his hand to shake Harrys but Harry didnt take it.",
    "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said\ncoolly.",
    "Draco Malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale\ncheeks.",
    "Id be careful if I were you Potter he said slowly.",
    "Unless youre a\nbit politer youll go the same way as your parents.",
    "They didnt know\nwhat was good for them either.",
    "You hang around with riffraff like the\nWeasleys and that Hagrid and itll rub off on you.",
    "Both Harry and Ron stood up.",
    "Say that again Ron said his face as red as his hair.",
    "Oh youre going to fight us are you Malfoy sneered.",
    "Unless you get out now said Harry more bravely than he felt because\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.",
    "But we dont feet like leaving do we boys Weve eaten all our food\nand you still seem to have some.",
    "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron  Ron leapt\nforward but before hed so much as touched Goyle Goyle let out a\nhorrible yell.",
    "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk\ndeep into Goyles knuckle  Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\nScabbers round and round howling and when Scabbets finally flew off\nand hit the window all three of them disappeared at once.",
    "Perhaps they\nthought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd\nheard footsteps because a second later Hermione Granger had come in.",
    "What has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.",
    "I think hes been knocked out Ron said to Harry.",
    "He looked closer at\nScabbers.",
    "No  I dont believe it  hes gone back to sleep\n\nAnd so he had.",
    "Youve met Malfoy before\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.",
    "Ive heard of his family said Ron darkly.",
    "They were some of the\nfirst to come back to our side after YouKnowWho disappeared.",
    "Said\ntheyd been bewitched.",
    "My dad doesnt believe it.",
    "He says Malfoys\nfather didnt need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.",
    "He turned to\nHermione.",
    "Can we help you with something\n\nYoud better hurry up and put your robes on Ive just been up to the\nfront to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there.",
    "You havent\nbeen fighting have you Youll be in trouble before we even get there\n\nScabbers has been fighting not us said Ron scowling at her.",
    "Would\nyou mind leaving while we change\n\nAll right  I only came in here because people outside are behaving\nvery childishly racing up and down the corridors said Hermione in a\nsniffy voice.",
    "And youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you\nknow\n\nRon glared at her as she left.",
    "Harry peered out of the window.",
    "It was\ngetting dark.",
    "He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple\nsky.",
    "The train did seem to be slowing down.",
    "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.",
    "Rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath\nthem.",
    "A voice echoed through the train We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\nminutes time.",
    "Please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken\nto the school separately.",
    "Harrys stomach lurched with nerves and Ron he saw looked pale under\nhis freckles.",
    "They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and\njoined the crowd thronging the corridor.",
    "The train slowed right down and finally stopped.",
    "People pushed their way\ntoward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform.",
    "Harry shivered in\nthe cold night air.",
    "Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the\nstudents and Harry heard a familiar voice Firs years Firs years\nover here All right there Harry\n\nHagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.",
    "Cmon follow me  any more firs years Mind yer step now Firs\nyears follow me\n\nSlipping and stumbling they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\nsteep narrow path.",
    "It was so dark on either side of them that Harry\nthought there must be thick trees there.",
    "Nobody spoke much.",
    "Neville the\nboy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice.",
    "Ye all get yer firs sight o Hogwarts in a sec Hagrid called over\nhis shoulder jus round this bend here.",
    "There was a loud Oooooh\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.",
    "Perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in\nthe starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.",
    "No moren four to a boat Hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little\nboats sitting in the water by the shore.",
    "Harry and Ron were followed\ninto their boat by Neville and Hermione.",
    "Everyone in shouted Hagrid\nwho had a boat to himself.",
    "Right then  FORWARD\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the\nlake which was as smooth as glass.",
    "Everyone was silent staring up at\nthe great castle overhead.",
    "It towered over them as they sailed nearer\nand nearer to the cliff on which it stood.",
    "Heads down yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\nof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.",
    "They were carried\nalong a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the\ncastle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they\nclambered out onto rocks and pebbles.",
    "Oy you there Is this your toad said Hagrid who was checking the\nboats as people climbed out of them.",
    "Trevor cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands.",
    "Then they\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrids lamp coming out at\nlast onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.",
    "They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge Oak\nfront door.",
    "Everyone here You there still got yer toad\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\ndoor.",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTHE SORTING HAT\n\nThe door swung open at once.",
    "A tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen\nrobes stood there.",
    "She had a very stern face and Harrys first thought\nwas that this was not someone to cross.",
    "The firs years Professor McGonagall said Hagrid.",
    "Thank you Hagrid.",
    "I will take them from here.",
    "She pulled the door wide.",
    "The entrance hall was so big you could have\nfit the whole of the Dursleys house in it.",
    "The stone walls were lit\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts the ceiling was too\nhigh to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to\nthe upper floors.",
    "They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.",
    "Harry\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\nthe rest of the school must already be here  but Professor McGonagall\nshowed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall.",
    "They\ncrowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have\ndone peering about nervously.",
    "Welcome to Hogwarts said Professor McGonagall.",
    "The startofterm\nbanquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the Great\nHall you will be sorted into your houses.",
    "The Sorting is a very\nimportant ceremony because while you are here your house will be\nsomething like your family within Hogwarts.",
    "You will have classes with\nthe rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free\ntime in your house common room.",
    "The four houses are called Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and\nSlytherin.",
    "Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\noutstanding witches and wizards.",
    "While you are at Hogwarts your\ntriumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose\nhouse points.",
    "At the end of the year the house with the most points is\nawarded the house cup a great honor.",
    "I hope each of you will be a\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours.",
    "The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\nrest of the school.",
    "I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\nyou can while you are waiting.",
    "Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilles cloak which was fastened\nunder his left ear and on Rons smudged nose.",
    "Harry nervously tried to\nflatten his hair.",
    "I shall return when we are ready for you said Professor McGonagall.",
    "Please wait quietly.",
    "She left the chamber.",
    "Harry swallowed.",
    "How exactly do they sort us into houses he asked Ron.",
    "Some sort of test I think.",
    "Fred said it hurts a lot but I think he\nwas joking.",
    "Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt.",
    "A test In front of the whole\nschool But he didnt know any magic yet  what on earth would he have\nto do He hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived.",
    "He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified\ntoo.",
    "No one was talking much except Hermione Granger who was whispering\nvery fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one\nshed need.",
    "Harry tried hard not to listen to her.",
    "Hed never been more\nnervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue.",
    "He\nkept his eyes fixed on the door.",
    "Any second now Professor McGonagall\nwould come back and lead him to his doom.",
    "Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air \nseveral people behind him screamed.",
    "What the \n\nHe gasped.",
    "So did the people around him.",
    "About twenty ghosts had just\nstreamed through the back wall.",
    "Pearlywhite and slightly transparent\nthey glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing\nat the first years.",
    "They seemed to be arguing.",
    "What looked like a fat\nlittle monk was saying Forgive and forget I say we ought to give him\na second chance \n\nMy dear Friar havent we given Peeves all the chances he deserves He\ngives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost  I\nsay what are you all doing here\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.",
    "Nobody answered.",
    "New students said the Fat Friar smiling around at them.",
    "About to be\nSorted I suppose\n\nA few people nodded mutely.",
    "Hope to see you in Hufflepuff said the Friar.",
    "My old house you\nknow.",
    "Move along now said a sharp voice.",
    "The Sorting Ceremonys about to\nstart.",
    "Professor McGonagall had returned.",
    "One by one the ghosts floated away\nthrough the opposite wall.",
    "Now form a line Professor McGonagall told the first years and\nfollow me.",
    "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead Harry got into line\nbehind a boy with sandy hair with Ron behind him and they walked out\nof the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors\ninto the Great Hall.",
    "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.",
    "It was\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\nover four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting.",
    "These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.",
    "At the\ntop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.",
    "Professor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a\nhalt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them.",
    "The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\nflickering candlelight.",
    "Dotted here and there among the students the\nghosts shone misty silver.",
    "Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes Harry\nlooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.",
    "He\nheard\n\nHermione whisper Its bewitched to look like the sky outside.",
    "I read\nabout it in Hogwarts A History.",
    "It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the\nGreat Hall didnt simply open on to the heavens.",
    "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\na fourlegged stool in front of the first years.",
    "On top of the stool she\nput a pointed wizards hat.",
    "This hat was patched and frayed and\nextremely dirty.",
    "Aunt Petunia wouldnt have let it in the house.",
    "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it Harry thought wildly\nthat seemed the sort of thing  noticing that everyone in the hall was\nnow staring at the hat he stared at it too.",
    "For a few seconds there\nwas complete silence.",
    "Then the hat twitched.",
    "A rip near the brim opened\nwide like a mouth  and the hat began to sing\n\nOh you may not think Im pretty\n\nBut dont judge on what you see\n\nIll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.",
    "You can keep your bowlers black\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall\n\nFor Im the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.",
    "Theres nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat cant see\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.",
    "You might belong in Gryffindor\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart\n\nTheir daring nerve and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff\n\nWhere they are just and loyal\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw\n\nif youve a ready mind\n\nWhere those of wit and learning\n\nWill always find their kind\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYoull make your real friends\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.",
    "So put me on Dont be afraid\n\nAnd dont get in a flap\n\nYoure in safe hands though I have none\n\nFor Im a Thinking Cap\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.",
    "It\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.",
    "So weve just got to try on the hat Ron whispered to Harry.",
    "Ill\nkill Fred he was going on about wrestling a troll.",
    "Harry.",
    "smiled weakly.",
    "Yes trying on the hat was a lot better than\nhaving to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on\nwithout everyone watching.",
    "The hat seemed to be asking rather alot\nHarry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment.",
    "If\nonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy\nthat would have been the one for him.",
    "Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\nparchment.",
    "When I call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to\nbe sorted she said.",
    "Abbott Hannah\n\nA pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the\nhat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down.",
    "A moments pause\n\n\nHUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat.",
    "The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\nthe Hufflepuff table.",
    "Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving\nmerrily at her.",
    "Bones Susan\n\nHUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat again and Susan scuttled off to sit next\nto Hannah.",
    "Boot Terry\n\nRAVENCLAW\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time several Ravenclaws\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.",
    "Brocklehurst Mandy went to Ravenclaw too but Brown Lavender\nbecame the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded\nwith cheers Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling.",
    "Bulstrode Millicent then became a Slytherin.",
    "Perhaps it was Harrys\nimagination after all hed heard about Slytherin but he thought they\nlooked like an unpleasant lot.",
    "He was starting to feel definitely sick\nnow.",
    "He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.",
    "He had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but\nbecause no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.",
    "FinchFletchley Justin\n\nHUFFLEPUFF\n\nSometimes Harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at\nothers it took a little while to decide.",
    "Finnigan Seamus the\nsandyhaired boy next to Harry in the line sat on the stool for almost\na whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.",
    "Granger Hermione\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.",
    "GRYFFINDOR shouted the hat.",
    "Ron groaned.",
    "A horrible thought struck Harry as horrible thoughts always do when\nyoure very nervous.",
    "What if he wasnt chosen at all What if he just\nsat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until Professor\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a\nmistake and hed better get back on the train\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called\nhe fell over on his way to the stool.",
    "The hat took a long time to decide\nwith Neville.",
    "When it finally shouted GRYFFINDOR Neville ran off\nstill wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it\nto MacDougal Morag.",
    "Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\nonce the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed SLYTHERIN\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle looking pleased with\nhimself.",
    "There werent many people left now.",
    "Moon Nott Parkinson then a\npair of twin girls Patil and Patil then Perks SallyAnne and\nthen at last  Potter Harry\n\nAs Harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little\nhissing fires all over the hall.",
    "Potter did she say\n\nThe Harry Potter\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him.",
    "Next second he\nwas looking at the black inside of the hat.",
    "He waited.",
    "Hmm said a small voice in his ear.",
    "Difficult.",
    "Very difficult.",
    "Plenty\nof courage I see.",
    "Not a bad mind either.",
    "Theres talent A my goodness\nyes  and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting....",
    "So where shall I put you\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought Not Slytherin not\nSlytherin.",
    "Not Slytherin eh said the small voice.",
    "Are you sure You could be\ngreat you know its all here in your head and Slytherin will help you\non the way to greatness no doubt about that  no Well if youre sure\n better be GRYFFINDOR\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.",
    "He took off\nthe hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.",
    "He was so\nrelieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin he hardly noticed\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet.",
    "Percy the Prefect got up and\nshook his hand vigorously while the Weasley twins yelled We got\nPotter We got Potter Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\nhed seen earlier.",
    "The ghost patted his arm giving Harry the sudden\nhorrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water.",
    "He could see the High Table properly now.",
    "At the end nearest him sat\nHagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.",
    "Harry grinned\nback.",
    "And there in the center of the High Table in a large gold chair\nsat Albus Dumbledore.",
    "Harry recognized him at once from the card hed\ngotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.",
    "Dumbledores silver hair\nwas the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the\nghosts.",
    "Harry spotted Professor Quirtell too the nervous young man\nfrom the Leaky Cauldron.",
    "He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\nturban.",
    "And now there were only three people left to be sorted.",
    "Thomas Dean\na Black boy even taller than Ron joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.",
    "Turpin Lisa became a Ravenclaw and then it was Rons turn.",
    "He was\npale green by now.",
    "Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a\nsecond later the hat had shouted GRYFFINDOR\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next\nto him.",
    "Well done Ron excellent said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\nas Zabini Blaise was made a Slytherin.",

    "Harry piled his\nplate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.",
    "It was all delicious.",
    "That does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching Harry\ncut up his steak\n\nCant you \n\nI havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost.",

    "What is it asked Percy.",
    "Nnothing.",
    "The pain had gone as quickly as it had come.",
    "Harder to shake off was the\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look  a feeling that he\ndidnt like Harry at all.",

    "Ahern  just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered.",
    "I\nhave a few startofterm notices to give you.",
    "First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to\nall pupils.",
    "And a few of our older students would do well to remember\nthat as well.",
    "Dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\ntwins.",

    "Harry laughed but he was one of the few who did.",
    "Hes not serious he muttered to Percy.",
    "Must be said Percy frowning at Dumbledore.",
    "Its odd because he\nusually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere  the\nforests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that.",
    "I do think he\nmight have told us prefects at least.",
    "And now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried\nDumbledore.",
    "Harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become\nrather fixed.",
    "Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a\nfly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose\nhigh above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words.",
    "Everyone pick their favorite tune said Dumbledore and off we go\nAnd the school bellowed\n\nHogwarts Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts\n\nTeach us something please\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff\n\nFor now theyre bare and full of air\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing\n\nBring back what weve forgot\n\njust do your best well do the rest\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.",

    "Ah music he said wiping his eyes.",
    "A magic beyond all we do here\nAnd now bedtime.",
    "Off you trot\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds\nout of the Great Hall and up the marble staircase.",
    "Harrys legs were\nlike lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food.",
    "He\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice\nPercy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging\ntapestries.",
    "They climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their\nfeet and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when\nthey came to a sudden halt.",
    "A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.",
    "Peeves Percy whispered to the first years.",
    "A poltergeist.",
    "He raised\nhis voice Peeves  show yourself\n\nA loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered.",
    "Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron\n\nThere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide\nmouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking\nsticks.",
    "Oooooooh he said with an evil cackle.",
    "Ickle Firsties What fun\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them.",
    "They all ducked.",
    "Go away Peeves or the Baronll hear about this I mean it barked\nPercy.",
    "Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on\nNevilles head.",
    "They heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as\nhe passed.",
    "You want to watch out for Peeves said Percy as they set off again.",
    "The Bloody Barons the only one who can control him he wont even\nlisten to us prefects.",
    "Here we are.",
    "At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\npink silk dress.",
    "Password she said.",
    "Caput Draconis said Percy and the portrait\nswung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.",
    "They all scrambled\nthrough it  Neville needed a leg up  and found themselves in the\nGryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs.",
    "Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the\nboys through another.",
    "At the top of a spiral staircase  they were\nobviously in one of the towers  they found their beds at last five\nfourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains.",
    "Their trunks had\nalready been brought up.",
    "Too tired to talk much they pulled on their\npajamas and fell into bed.",
    "Great food isnt it Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.",
    "Get off Scabbers Hes chewing my sheets.",
    "Harry was going to ask Ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he\nfell asleep almost at once.",
    "Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange\ndream.",
    "He was wearing Professor Quirrells turban which kept talking to\nhim telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once because it was\nhis destiny.",
    "Harry told the turban he didnt want to be in Slytherin it\ngot heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully  and there was Malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with\nit then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher Snape whose laugh\nbecame high and cold  there was a burst of green light and Harry woke\nsweating and shaking.",
    "He rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he\ndidnt remember the dream at all.",

    "Where\n\nNext to the tall kid with the red hair.",

    "People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look\nat him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring.",
    "Harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on\nfinding his way to classes.",
    "There were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at Hogwarts wide\nsweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different\non a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\nremember to jump.",
    "Then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you\nasked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors\nthat werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending.",
    "It\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed\nto move around a lot.",
    "The people in the portraits kept going to visit\neach other and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.",
    "The ghosts didnt help either.",
    "It was always a nasty shock when one of\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.",
    "Nearly\nHeadless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right\ndirection but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a\ntrick staircase if you met him when you were late for class.",
    "He would\ndrop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet\npelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab\nyour nose and screech GOT YOUR CONK\n\nEven worse than Peeves if that was possible was the caretaker Argus\nFilch.",
    "Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their\nvery first morning.",
    "Filch found them trying to force their way through a\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds\ncorridor on the third floor.",
    "He wouldnt believe they were lost was\nsure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening\nto lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor\nQuirrell who was passing.",
    "Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris a scrawny dustcolored creature\nwith bulging lamp like eyes just like Filchs.",
    "She patrolled the\ncorridors alone.",
    "Break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of\nline and shed whisk off for Filch whod appear wheezing two seconds\nlater.",
    "Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than\nanyone except perhaps the Weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly\nas any of the ghosts.",
    "The students all hated him and it was the dearest\nambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.",
    "And then once you had managed to find them there were the classes\nthemselves.",
    "There was a lot more to magic as Harry quickly found out\nthan waving your wand and saying a few funny words.",
    "They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the\nmovements of the planets.",
    "Three times a week they went out to the\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology with a dumpy little\nwitch called Professor Sprout where they learned how to take care of\nall the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for.",
    "Easily the most boring class was History of Magic which was the only\none taught by a ghost.",
    "Professor Binns had been very old\n\nindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\nup next morning to teach leaving his body behind him.",
    "Binns droned on\nand on while they scribbled down names and dates and got Emetic the\nEvil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.",
    "Professor Flitwick the Charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.",
    "At the start of their\nfirst class he took the roll call and when he reached Harrys name he\ngave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.",
    "Professor McGonagall was again different.",
    "Harry had been quite right to\nthink she wasnt a teacher to cross.",
    "Strict and clever she gave them a\ntalkingto the moment they sat down in her first class.",
    "Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\nwill learn at Hogwarts she said.",
    "Anyone messing around in my class\nwill leave and not come back.",
    "You have been warned.",
    "Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.",
    "They were all very\nimpressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they\nwerent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.",
    "After taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match\nand started trying to turn it into a needle.",
    "By the end of the lesson\nonly Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match Professor\nMcGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and\ngave Hermione a rare smile.",
    "The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts but Quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of\na joke.",
    "His classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said\nwas to ward off a vampire hed met in Romania and was afraid would be\ncoming back to get him one of these days.",
    "His turban he told them had\nbeen given to him by an African prince as a thankyou for getting rid of\na troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story.",
    "For one thing when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell\nhad fought off the zombie Quirrell went pink and started talking about\nthe weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung\naround the turban and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed\nfull of garlic as well so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.",
    "Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone\nelse.",
    "Lots of people had come from Muggle families and like him hadnt\nhad any idea that they were witches and wizards.",
    "There was so much to\nlearn that even people like Ron didnt have much of a head start.",
    "Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.",
    "They finally managed to\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\nonce.",
    "What have we got today Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\nporridge.",
    "Double Potions with the Slytherins said Ron.",
    "Snapes Head of\nSlytherin House.",
    "They say he always favors them  well be able to see\nif its true.",
    "Wish McGonagall favored us  said Harry.",
    "Professor McGonagall was head\nof Gryffindor House but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge\npile of homework the day before.",
    "Just then the mail arrived.",
    "Harry had gotten used to this by now but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a\nhundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters\nand packages onto their laps.",
    "Hedwig hadnt brought Harry anything so far.",
    "She sometimes flew in to\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the\nowlery with the other school owls.",
    "This morning however she fluttered\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\nHarrys plate.",
    "Harry tore it open at once.",
    "It said in a very untidy\nscrawl\n\n\nDear Harry\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have\na cup of tea with me around three\n\nI want to hear all about your first week.",
    "Send us an answer back with\nHedwig.",
    "Hagrid\n\n\nHarry borrowed Rons quill scribbled Yes please see you later on the\nback of the note and sent Hedwig off again.",
    "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to because\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\nhim so far.",
    "At the startofterm banquet Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\nSnape disliked him.",
    "By the end of the first Potions lesson he knew hed\nbeen wrong.",
    "Snape didnt dislike Harry  he hated him.",
    "Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons.",
    "It was colder\nhere than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.",
    "Snape like Flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and\nlike Flitwick he paused at Harrys name.",
    "Ah Yes he said softly Harry Potter.",
    "Our new  celebrity.",
    "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\nhands.",
    "Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.",
    "His\neyes were black like Hagrids but they had none of Hagrids warmth.",
    "They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.",
    "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking he began.",
    "He spoke in barely more than a whisper but\nthey caught every word  like Professor McGonagall Snape had y caught\nevery word  like Professor McGonagall Snape had the gift of keeping a\nclass silent without effort.",
    "As there is little foolish wandwaving\nhere many of you will hardly believe this is magic.",
    "I dont expect you\nwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with\nits shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through\nhuman veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses....",
    "I can teach\nyou how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death  if you arent\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.",
    "More silence followed this little speech.",
    "Harry and Ron exchanged looks\nwith raised eyebrows.",
    "Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and\nlooked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead.",
    "Potter said Snape suddenly.",
    "What would I get if I added powdered\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what Harry glanced at Ron who\nlooked as stumped as he was Hermiones hand had shot into the air.",
    "I dont know sit said Harry.",
    "Snapes lips curled into a sneer.",
    "Tut tut  fame clearly isnt everything.",
    "He ignored Hermiones hand.",
    "Lets try again.",
    "Potter where would you look if I told you to find me\na bezoar\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\nher leaving her seat but Harry didnt have the faintest idea what a\nbezoar was.",
    "He tried not to look at Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle who were\nshaking with laughter.",
    "I dont know sit.",
    "Thought you wouldnt open a book before coming\neh Potter Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those\ncold eyes.",
    "He had looked through his books at the Dursleys but did\nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs\nand Fungi\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermiones quivering hand.",
    "What is the difference Potter between monkshood and wolfsbane\n\nAt this Hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon\nceiling.",
    "I dont know said Harry quietly.",
    "I think Hermione does though why\ndont you try her\n\nA few people laughed Harry caught Seamuss eye and Seamus winked.",
    "Snape however was not pleased.",
    "Sit down he snapped at Hermione.",
    "For your information Potter\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as\nthe Draught of Living Death.",
    "A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach\nof a goat and it will save you from most poisons.",
    "As for monkshood and\nwolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of\naconite.",
    "Well Why arent you all copying that down\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment.",
    "Over the noise\nSnape said And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your\ncheek Potter.",
    "Things didnt improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\ncontinued.",
    "Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a\nsimple potion to cure boils.",
    "He swept around in his long black cloak\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing\nalmost everyone except Malfoy whom he seemed to like.",
    "He was just\ntelling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned\nslugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the\ndungeon.",
    "Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a\ntwisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor\nburning holes in peoples shoes.",
    "Within seconds the whole class was\nstanding on their stools while Neville who had been drenched in the\npotion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils\nsprang up all over his arms and legs.",
    "Idiot boy snarled Snape clearing the spilled potion away with one\nwave of his wand.",
    "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before\ntaking the cauldron off the fire\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.",
    "Take him up to the hospital wing Snape spat at Seamus.",
    "Then he\nrounded on Harry and Ron who had been working next to Neville.",
    "You  Potter  why didnt you tell him not to add the quills Thought\nhed make you look good if he got it wrong did you Thats another\npoint youve lost for Gryffindor.",
    "This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron kicked\nhim behind their cauldron.",
    "Doi push it he muttered Ive heard Snape can turn very nasty.",
    "As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later Harrys mind\nwas racing and his spirits were low.",
    "Hed lost two points for Gryffindor\nin his very first week  why did Snape hate him so much Cheer up\nsaid Ron Snapes always taking points off Fred and George.",
    "Can I come\nand meet Hagrid with you\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\ngrounds.",
    "Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\nforbidden forest.",
    "A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\nfront door.",
    "When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\nseveral booming barks.",
    "Then Hagrids voice rang out saying Back Fang\n back.",
    "Hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\nopen.",
    "Hang on he said.",
    "Back Fang.",
    "He let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\nblack boarhound.",
    "There was only one room inside.",
    "Hams and pheasants were hanging from the\nceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner\nstood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.",
    "Make yerselves at home said Hagrid letting go of Fang who bounded\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears.",
    "Like Hagrid Fang was\nclearly not as fierce as he looked.",
    "This is Ron Harry told Hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",
    "Another Weasley eh said Hagrid glancing at Rons freckles.",
    "I spent\nhalf me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest.",
    "The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\nteeth but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told\nHagrid all about their first lessons.",
    "Fang rested his head on Harrys\nknee and drooled all over his robes.",
    "Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch that old git.",
    "An as fer that cat Mrs. Norris Id like ter introduce her to Fang\nsometime.",
    "Dyeh know every time I go up ter the school she follows me\neverywhere Cant get rid of her  Fitch puts her up to it.",
    "Harry told Hagrid about Snapes lesson.",
    "Hagrid like Ron told Harry not\nto worry about it that Snape liked hardly any of the students.",
    "But he seemed to really hate me.",
    "Rubbish said Hagrid.",
    "Why should he\n\nYet Harry couldnt help thinking that Hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes\nwhen he said that.",
    "Hows yer brother Charlie Hagrid asked Ron.",
    "I liked him a lot \ngreat with animals.",
    "Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.",
    "While Ron\ntold Hagrid all about Charlies work with dragons Harry picked up a\npiece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.",
    "It was a\ncutting from the Daily Prophet\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAKIN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the breakin at Gringotts on 31 July\nwidely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.",
    "Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken.",
    "The vault\nthat was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.",
    "But were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if\nyou know whats good for you said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this\nafternoon.",
    "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to\nrob Gringotts but Ron hadnt mentioned the date.",
    "Hagrid said Harry that Gringotts breakin happened on my birthday\nIt mightve been happening while we were there\n\nThere was no doubt about it Hagrid definitely didnt meet Harrys eyes\nthis time.",
    "He grunted and offered him another rock cake.",
    "Harry read the\nstory again.",
    "The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\nearlier that same day.",
    "Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and\nthirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little\npackage.",
    "Had that been what the thieves were looking for\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets\nweighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse Harry\nthought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much\nto think about as tea with Hagrid.",
    "Had Hagrid collected that package\njust in time Where was it now And did Hagrid know something about\nSnape that he didnt want to tell Harry\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy.",
    "Still firstyear\nGryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins so they didnt have to\nput up with Malfoy much.",
    "Or at least they didnt until they spotted a\nnotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.",
    "Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday  and Gryffindor and\nSlytherin\twould be learning together.",
    "Typical said Harry darkly.",
    "Just what I always wanted.",
    "To make a fool\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.",
    "He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.",
    "You dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said Ron\nreasonably.",
    "Anyway I know Malfoys always going on about how good he\nis at Quidditch but I bet thats all talk.",
    "Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot.",
    "He complained loudly about\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long\nboastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping\nMuggles in helicopters.",
    "He wasnt the only one though the way Seamus\nFinnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the\ncountryside on his broomstick.",
    "Even Ron would tell anyone whod listen\nabout the time hed almost hit a hang glider on Charlies old broom.",
    "Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.",
    "Ron\nhad already had a big argument with Dean Thomas who shared their\ndormitory about soccer.",
    "Ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game\nwith only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.",
    "Harry had caught Ron\nprodding Deans poster of West Ham soccer team trying to make the\nplayers move.",
    "Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his\ngrandmother had never let him near one.",
    "Privately Harry felt shed had\ngood reason because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.",
    "Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.",
    "This\nwas something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book  not that she\nhadnt tried.",
    "At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with\nflying tips shed gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through\nthe Ages.",
    "Neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for\nanything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but\neverybody else was very pleased when Hermiones lecture was interrupted\nby the arrival of the mail.",
    "Harry hadnt had a single letter since Hagrids note something that\nMalfoy had been quick to notice of course.",
    "Malfoys eagle owl was\nalways bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.",
    "A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.",
    "He\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large\nmarble which seemed to be full of white smoke.",
    "Its a Remembrall he explained.",
    "Gran knows I forget things  this\ntells you if theres something youve forgotten to do.",
    "Look you hold it\ntight like this and if it turns red  oh... His face fell because the\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet\n\nYouve forgotten something...\n\nNeville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when Draco Malfoy\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table snatched the Remembrall out of his\nhand.",
    "Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.",
    "They were half hoping for a reason\nto fight Malfay but Professor McGonagall who could spot trouble\nquicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash.",
    "Whats going on\n\nMalfoys got my Remembrall Professor.",
    "Scowling Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.",
    "Just looking he said and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\nhim.",
    "At threethirty that afternoon Harry Ron and the other Gryffindors\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\nlesson.",
    "It was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn\non the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.",
    "The Slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying\nin neat lines on the ground.",
    "Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley\ncomplain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to\nvibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left.",
    "Their teacher Madam Hooch arrived.",
    "She had short gray hair and\nyellow eyes like a hawk.",
    "Well what are you all waiting for she barked.",
    "Everyone stand by a\nbroomstick.",
    "Come on hurry up.",
    "Harry glanced down at his broom.",
    "It was old and some of the twigs stuck\nout at odd angles.",
    "Stick out your right hand over your broom called Madam Hooch at the\nfront and say Up\n\nUPF everyone shouted.",
    "Harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few\nthat did.",
    "Hermione Grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and\nNevilles hadnt moved at all.",
    "Perhaps brooms like horses could tell\nwhen you were afraid thought Harry there was a quaver in Nevilles\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the\nground.",
    "Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\noff the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.",
    "Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy hed been doing it\nwrong for years.",
    "Now when I blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said\nMadam Hooch.",
    "Keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly.",
    "On my whistle  three\n two \n\nBut Neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\nground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochs\nlips.",
    "Come back boy she shouted but Neville was rising straight up like a\ncork shot out of a bottle  twelve feet  twenty feet.",
    "Harry saw his\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp\nslip sideways off the broom and \n\nWHAM  a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\nin a heap.",
    "His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.",
    "Madam Hooch was bending over Neville her face as white as his.",
    "Broken wrist Harry heard her mutter.",
    "Come on boy  its all right\nup you get..\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.",
    "None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing You\nleave those brooms where they are or youll be out of Hogwarts before\nyou can say Quidditch.",
    "Come on dear.",
    "Neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with\nMadam Hooch who had her arm around him.",
    "No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.",
    "Did you see his face the great lump\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.",
    "Shut up Malfoy snapped Parvati Patil.",
    "Ooh sticking up for Longbottom said Pansy Parkinson a hardfaced\nSlytherin girl.",
    "Never thought youd like fat little crybabies\nParvati.",
    "Look said Malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the\ngrass.",
    "Its that stupid thing Longbottoms gran sent him.",
    "The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.",
    "Give that here Malfoy said Harry quietly.",
    "Everyone stopped talking\nto watch.",
    "Malfoy smiled nastily.",
    "I think Ill leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find  how about \nup a tree\n\nGive it here Harry yelled but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\nand taken off.",
    "He hadnt been lying he could fly well.",
    "Hovering level\nwith the topmost branches of an oak he called Come and get it\nPotter\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.",
    "No shouted Hermione Granger.",
    "Madam Hooch told us not to move \nyoull get us all into trouble.",
    "Harry ignored her.",
    "Blood was pounding in his ears.",
    "He mounted the broom\nand kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed\nthrough his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of\nfierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being\ntaught  this was easy this was wonderful.",
    "He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls\nback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.",
    "He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.",
    "Malfoy looked\nstunned.",
    "Give it here Harry called or Ill knock you off that broom Oh\nyeah said Malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried.",
    "Harry knew somehow what to do.",
    "He leaned forward and grasped the broom\ntightly in both hands and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin.",
    "Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time Harry made a sharp aboutface and\nheld the broom steady.",
    "A few people below were clapping.",
    "No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck Malfoy Harry called.",
    "The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.",
    "Catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.",
    "Harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall.",
    "He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball\n wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people\nwatching  he stretched out his hand  a foot from the ground he\ncaught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.",
    "HARRY POTTER\n\nHis heart sank faster than hed just dived.",
    "Professor McGonagall was\nrunning toward them.",
    "He got to his feet trembling.",
    "Never  in all my time at Hogwarts \n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses\nflashed furiously  how dare you  might have broken your neck \n\nIt wasnt his fault Professor \n\nBe quiet Miss Patil\n\nBut Malfoy \n\nThats enough Mr. Weasley.",
    "Potter follow me now.",
    "Harry caught sight of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles triumphant faces as he\nleft walking numbly in Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward\nthe castle.",
    "He was going to be expelled he just knew it.",
    "He wanted to\nsay something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong\nwith his voice.",
    "Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even\nlooking at him he had to jog to keep up.",
    "Now hed done it.",
    "He hadnt\neven lasted two weeks.",
    "Hed be packing his bags in ten minutes.",
    "What\nwould the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep\n\nUp the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still Professor\nMcGonagall didnt say a word to him.",
    "She wrenched open doors and marched\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.",
    "Maybe she was\ntaking him to Dumbledore.",
    "He thought of Hagrid expelled but allowed to\nstay on as gamekeeper.",
    "Perhaps he could be Hagrids assistant.",
    "His\nstomach twisted as he imagined it watching Ron and the others becoming\nwizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag.",
    "Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.",
    "She opened the door\nand poked her head inside.",
    "Excuse me Professor Flitwick could I borrow Wood for a moment\n\nWood thought Harry bewildered was Wood a cane she was going to use on\nhim\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out\nof Flitwicles class looking confused.",
    "Follow me you two said Professor McGonagall and they marched on up\nthe corridor Wood looking curiously at Harry.",
    "In here.",
    "Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except\nfor Peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.",
    "Out Peeves she barked.",
    "Peeves threw the chalk into a bin which\nclanged loudly and he swooped out cursing.",
    "Professor McGonagall slammed\nthe door behind him and turned to face the two boys.",
    "Potter this is Oliver Wood.",
    "Wood  Ive found you a Seeker.",
    "Woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight.",
    "Are you serious Professor\n\nAbsolutely said Professor McGonagall crisply.",
    "The boys a natural.",
    "Ive never seen anything like it.",
    "Was that your first time on a\nbroomstick Potter\n\nHarry nodded silently.",
    "He didnt have a clue what was going on but he\ndidnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming\nback to his legs.",
    "He caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive Professor\nMcGonagall told Wood.",
    "Didnt even scratch himself.",
    "Charlie Weasley\ncouldnt have done it.",
    "Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.",
    "Ever seen a game of Quidditch Potter he asked excitedly.",
    "Woods captain of the Gryffindor team Professor McGonagall explained.",
    "Hes just the build for a Seeker too said Wood now walking around\nHarry and staring at him.",
    "Light  speedy  well have to get him a\ndecent broom Professor  a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven\nId say.",
    "I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we cant bend the\nfirstyear rule.",
    "Heaven knows we need a better team than last year.",
    "Flattened in that last match by Slytherin I couldnt look Severus Snape\nin the face for weeks....",
    "Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.",
    "I want to hear youre training hard Potter or I may change my mind\nabout punishing you.",
    "Then she suddenly smiled.",
    "Your father would have been proud she said.",
    "He was an excellent\nQuidditch player himself.",
    "Youre joking.",
    "It was dinnertime.",
    "Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\nwhen hed left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.",
    "Ron had a piece of\nsteak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about\nit.",
    "Seeker he said.",
    "But first years never  you must be the youngest\nhouse player in about a century said Harry shoveling pie into his\nmouth.",
    "He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\nafternoon.",
    "Wood told me.",
    "Ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at Harry.",
    "I start training next week said Harry.",
    "Only dont tell anyone Wood\nwants to keep it a secret.",
    "Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall spotted Harry and\nhurried over.",
    "Well done said George in a low voice.",
    "Wood told us.",
    "Were on the\nteam too  Beaters.",
    "I tell you were going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year\nsaid Fred.",
    "We havent won since Charlie left but this years team is\ngoing to be brilliant.",
    "You must be good Harry Wood was almost skipping\nwhen he told us.",
    "Anyway weve got to go Lee Jordan reckons hes found a new secret\npassageway out of the school.",
    "Bet its that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\nin our first week.",
    "See you.",
    "Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\nturned up Malfoy flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.",
    "Having a last meal Potter When are you getting the train back to the\nMuggles\n\nYoure a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got\nyour little friends with you said Harry coolly.",
    "There was of course\nnothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle but as the High Table was\nfull of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their\nknuckles and scowl.",
    "Id take you on anytime on my own said Malfoy.",
    "Tonight if you want.",
    "Wizards duel.",
    "Wands only  no contact.",
    "Whats the matter Never heard\nof a wizards duel before I suppose\n\nOf course he has said Ron wheeling around.",
    "Im his second whos\nyours\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle sizing them up.",
    "Crabbe he said.",
    "Midnight all right Well meet you in the trophy\nroom thats always unlocked.",
    "When Malfoy had gone Ron and Harry looked at each other.",
    "What is a\nwizards duel said Harry.",
    "And what do you mean youre my second\n\nWell a seconds there to take over if you die said Ron casually\ngetting started at last on his cold pie.",
    "Catching the look on Harrys\nface he added quickly But people only die in proper duels you know\nwith real wizards.",
    "The most you and Malfoyll be able to do is send\nsparks at each other.",
    "Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real\ndamage.",
    "I bet he expected you to refuse anyway.",
    "And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens\n\nThrow it away and punch him on the nose Ron suggested.",
    "Excuse me.",
    "They both looked up.",
    "It was Hermione Granger.",
    "Cant a person eat in peace in this place said Ron.",
    "Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.",
    "I couldnt help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying \n\nBet you could Ron muttered.",
    "and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the\npoints youll lose Gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be.",
    "Its really very selfish of you.",
    "And its really none of your business said Harry.",
    "Goodbye said Ron.",
    "All the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day\nHarry thought as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus\nfalling asleep Neville wasnt back from the hospital wing.",
    "Ron had\nspent all evening giving him advice such as If he tries to curse you\nyoud better dodge it because I cant remember how to block them.",
    "There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or\nMrs. Norris and Harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another\nschool rule today.",
    "On the other hand Malfoys sneering face kept looming\nup out of the darkness  this was his big chance to beat Malfoy\nfacetoface.",
    "He couldnt miss it.",
    "Halfpast eleven Ron muttered at last wed better go.",
    "They pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across\nthe tower room down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor\ncommon room.",
    "A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning\nall the armchairs into hunched black shadows.",
    "They had almost reached\nthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them I\ncant believe youre going to do this Harry.",
    "A lamp flickered on.",
    "It was Hermione Granger wearing a pink bathrobe\nand a frown.",
    "You said Ron furiously.",
    "Go back to bed\n\nI almost told your brother Hermione snapped Percy  hes a\nprefect hed put a stop to this.",
    "Harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering.",
    "Come on he said to Ron.",
    "He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\nand climbed through the hole.",
    "Hermione wasnt going to give up that easily.",
    "She followed Ron through\nthe portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose.",
    "Dont you care about Gryffindor do you only care about yourselves I\ndont want Slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the\npoints I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching\nSpells.",
    "Go away.",
    "All right but I warned you you just remember what I said\nwhen youre on the train home tomorrow youre so \n\nBut what they were they didnt find out.",
    "Hermione had turned to the\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an\nempty painting.",
    "The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione\nwas locked out of Gryffindor tower.",
    "Now what am I going to do she asked shrilly.",
    "Thats your problem said Ron.",
    "Weve got to go we 3 re going to be\nlate.",
    "They hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up\nwith them.",
    "Im coming with you she said.",
    "You are not.",
    "Dyou think Im going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me\nIf he finds all three of us Ill tell him the truth that I was trying\nto stop you and you can back me up.",
    "Youve got some nerve  said Ron loudly.",
    "Shut up both of you said Harry sharply.",
    "I heard something.",
    "It was a sort of snuffling.",
    "Mrs. Norris breathed Ron squinting through the dark.",
    "It wasnt Mrs. Norris.",
    "It was Neville.",
    "He was curled up on the floor\nfast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.",
    "Thank goodness you found me Ive been out here for hours I couldnt\nremember the new password to get in to bed.",
    "Keep your voice down Neville.",
    "The passwords Pig snout but it wont\nhelp you now the Fat Ladys gone off somewhere.",
    "Hows your arm said Harry.",
    "Fine said Neville showing them.",
    "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a\nminute.",
    "Good  well look Neville weve got to be somewhere well see you\nlater \n\nDont leave me said Neville scrambling to his feet I dont want to\nstay here alone the Bloody Barons been past twice already.",
    "Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\nNeville.",
    "If either of you get us caught Ill never rest until Ive learned that\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you.",
    "Hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\nCurse of the Bogies but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned\nthem all forward.",
    "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\nhigh windows.",
    "At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.\nNorris but they were lucky.",
    "They sped up a staircase to the third floor\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room.",
    "Malfoy and Crabbe werent there yet.",
    "The crystal trophy cases glimmered\nwhere the moonlight caught them.",
    "Cups shields plates and statues\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness.",
    "They edged along the walls\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.",
    "Harry took\nout his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.",
    "The minutes\ncrept by.",
    "Hes late maybe hes chickened out Ron whispered.",
    "Then a noise in the next room made them jump.",
    "Harry had only just raised\nhis wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt Malfoy.",
    "Sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner.",
    "It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris.",
    "Horrorstruck Harry waved madly\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried\nsilently toward the door away from Filchs voice.",
    "Nevilles robes had\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy\nroom.",
    "Theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding.",
    "This way Harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.",
    "They could hear Filch\ngetting nearer.",
    "Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke\ninto a run he tripped grabbed Ron around the waist and the pair of\nthem toppled right into a suit of armor.",
    "The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.",
    "RUN Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following  they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another Harry in the lead\nwithout any idea where they were or where they were going  they ripped\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled\nalong it and came out near their Charms classroom which they knew was\nmiles from the trophy room.",
    "I think weve lost him Harry panted leaning against the cold wall\nand wiping his forehead.",
    "Neville was bent double wheezing and\nspluttering.",
    "I  told you Hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest\nI  told  you.",
    "Weve got to get back to Gryffindor tower said Ron quickly as\npossible.",
    "Malfoy tricked you Hermione said to Harry.",
    "You realize that dont\nyou He was never going to meet you  Filch knew someone was going to\nbe in the trophy room Malfoy must have tipped him off.",
    "Harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her\nthat.",
    "Lets go.",
    "It wasnt going to be that simple.",
    "They hadnt gone more than a dozen\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a\nclassroom in front of them.",
    "It was Peeves.",
    "He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.",
    "Shut up Peeves  please  youll get us thrown out.",
    "Peeves cackled.",
    "Wandering around at midnight Ickle Firsties Tut tut tut.",
    "Naughty\nnaughty youll get caughty.",
    "Not if you dont give us away Peeves please.",
    "Should tell Filch I should said Peeves in a saintly voice but his\neyes glittered wickedly.",
    "Its for your own good you know.",
    "Get out of the way snapped Ron taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\nbig mistake.",
    "STUDENTS OUT OF BED Peeves bellowed STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE\nCHARMS CORRIDOR\n\nDucking under Peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the\ncorridor where they slammed into a door  and it was locked.",
    "This is it Ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door Were\ndone for This is the end They could hear footsteps Filch running as\nfast as he could toward Peevess shouts.",
    "Oh move over Hermione snarled.",
    "She grabbed Harrys wand tapped the\nlock and whispered Alohomora\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open  they piled through it shut\nit quickly and pressed their ears against it listening.",
    "Which way did they go Peeves Filch was saying.",
    "Quick tell me.",
    "Say please.",
    "Dont mess with me Peeves now where did they go\n\nShant say nothing if you dont say please said Peeves in his\nannoying singsong voice.",
    "All right please.",
    "NOTHING Ha haaa Told you I wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say\nplease Ha ha Haaaaaa And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing\naway and Filch cursing in rage.",
    "He thinks this door is locked Harry whispered.",
    "I think well be okay\n get off Neville For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of\nHarrys bathrobe for the last minute.",
    "What\n\nHarry turned around  and saw quite clearly what.",
    "For a moment he\nwas sure hed walked into a nightmare  this was too much on top of\neverything that had happened so far.",
    "They werent in a room as he had supposed.",
    "They were in a corridor.",
    "The\nforbidden corridor on the third floor.",
    "And now they knew why it was\nforbidden.",
    "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor.",
    "It had three heads.",
    "Three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching\n\nand quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging\nin slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.",
    "It was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and Harry\nknew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their\nsudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting\nover that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.",
    "Harry groped for the doorknob  between Filch and death hed take\nFilch.",
    "They fell backward  Harry slammed the door shut and they ran they\nalmost flew back down the corridor.",
    "Filch must have hurried off to look\nfor them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they\nhardly cared  all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible\nbetween them and that monster.",
    "They didnt stop running until they\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.",
    "Where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces.",
    "Never mind that  pig snout pig snout panted Harry and the\nportrait swung forward.",
    "They scrambled into the common room and\ncollapsed trembling into armchairs.",
    "It was a while before any of them said anything.",
    "Neville indeed looked\nas if hed never speak again.",
    "What do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up\nin a school said Ron finally.",
    "If any dog needs exercise that one\ndoes.",
    "Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.",
    "You\ndont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped.",
    "Didnt you see\nwhat it was standing on.",
    "The floor Harry suggested.",
    "I wasnt looking at its feet I was too\nbusy with its heads.",
    "No not the floor.",
    "It was standing on a trapdoor.",
    "Its obviously\nguarding something.",
    "She stood up glaring at them.",
    "I hope youre pleased with yourselves.",
    "We could all have been killed \nor worse expelled.",
    "Now if you dont mind Im going to bed.",
    "Ron stared after her his mouth open.",
    "No we dont mind he said.",
    "Youd think we dragged her along\nwouldnt you.",
    "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\nback into bed.",
    "The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\nhide  except perhaps Hogwarts.",
    "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.",
    "CHAPTER TEN\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nMalfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\nstill at Hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful.",
    "Indeed by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the\nthreeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite\nkeen to have another one.",
    "In the meantime Harry filled Ron in about the\npackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts and\nthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\nprotection.",
    "Its either really valuable or really dangerous said Ron.",
    "Or both said Harry.",
    "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\nwas about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what\nit was without further clues.",
    "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor.",
    "All Neville cared about was never\ngoing near the dog again.",
    "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron but she was such a\nbossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus.",
    "All they really\nwanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy and to their great\ndelight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.",
    "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual everyones attention\nwas caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech\nowls.",
    "Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\nit right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor.",
    "They had\nhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top\nof the parcel.",
    "Harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.",
    "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand but I dont want everybody\nknowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one.",
    "Oliver Wood\nwill meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oclock for your\nfirst training session.",
    "Professor McGonagall\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\nread.",
    "A Nimbus Two Thousand Ron moaned enviously.",
    "Ive never even touched\none.",
    "They left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\nbefore their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they\nfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.",
    "Malfoy seized the\npackage from Harry and felt it.",
    "Thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\nof jealousy and spite on his face.",
    "Youll be in for it this time\nPotter first years arent allowed them.",
    "Ron couldnt resist it.",
    "Its not any old broomstick he said its a Nimbus Two Thousand.",
    "What did you say youve got at home Malfoy a Comet Two Sixty Ron\ngrinned at Harry.",
    "Comets look flashy but theyre not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus.",
    "What would you know about it Weasley you couldnt afford half the\nhandle Malfoy snapped back.",
    "I suppose you and your brothers have to\nsave up twig by twig.",
    "Before Ron could answer Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoys elbow.",
    "Not arguing I hope boys he squeaked.",
    "Potters been sent a broomstick Professor said Malfoy quickly.",
    "Yes yes thats right said Professor Flitwick beaming at Harry.",
    "Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances\nPotter.",
    "And what model is it\n\nA Nimbus Two Thousand sit said Harry fighting not to laugh at the\nlook of horror on Malfoys face.",
    "And its really thanks to Malfoy here\nthat Ive got it he added.",
    "Harry and Ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at Malfoys\nobvious rage and confusion.",
    "Well its true Harry chortled as they\nreached the top of the marble staircase If he hadnt stolen Nevilles\nRemembrall I woulnt be on the team....",
    "So I suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an\nangry voice from just behind them.",
    "Hermione was stomping up the stairs\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand.",
    "I thought you werent speaking to us said Harry.",
    "Yes dont stop now said Ron its doing us so much good.",
    "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.",
    "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.",
    "It\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\nunder his bed or straying off to the Quidditch field where hed be\nlearning to play that night.",
    "He bolted his dinner that evening without\nnoticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.",
    "Wow Ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto Harrys bedspread.",
    "Even Harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it\nlooked wonderful.",
    "Sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long\ntail of neat straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\nnear the top.",
    "As seven oclock drew nearer Harry left the castle and set off in the\ndusk toward the Quidditch field.",
    "Held never been inside the stadium\nbefore.",
    "Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on.",
    "At either end\nof the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.",
    "They\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\n\nchildren blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high.",
    "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood Harry mounted his broomstick\nand kicked off from the ground.",
    "What a feeling  he swooped in and out\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.",
    "The Nimbus Two\nThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.",
    "Hey Potter come down\n\nOliver Wood had arrived.",
    "fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\narm.",
    "Harry landed next to him.",
    "Very nice said Wood his eyes glinting.",
    "I see what McGonagall\nmeant... you really are a natural.",
    "Im just going to teach you the rules\nthis evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week.",
    "He opened the crate.",
    "Inside were four differentsized balls.",
    "Right said Wood.",
    "Now Quidditch is easy enough to understand even\nif its not too easy to play.",
    "There are seven players on each side.",
    "Three of them are called Chasers.",
    "Three Chasers Harry repeated as Wood took out a bright red ball\nabout the size of a soccer ball.",
    "This balls called the Quaffle said Wood.",
    "The Chasers throw the\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\nscore a goal.",
    "Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\nhoops.",
    "Follow me\n\nThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score\nHarry recited.",
    "So  thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with\nsix hoops isnt it\n\nWhats basketball said Wood curiously.",
    "Never mind said Harry\nquickly.",
    "Now theres another player on each side whos called the Keeper Im\nKeeper for Gryffindor.",
    "I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other\nteam from scoring.",
    "Three Chasers one Keeper said Harry who was determined to remember\nit all.",
    "And they play with the Quaffle.",
    "Okay got that.",
    "So what are\nthey for He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.",
    "Ill show you now said Wood.",
    "Take this.",
    "He handed Harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat.",
    "Im going to show you what the Bludgers do Wood said.",
    "These two are\nthe Bludgers.",
    "He showed Harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than\nthe red Quaffle.",
    "Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.",
    "Stand back Wood warned Harry.",
    "He bent down and freed one of the\nBludgers.",
    "At once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\nHarrys face.",
    "Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\nhis nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air  it zoomed around\ntheir heads and then shot at Wood who dived on top of it and managed to\npin it to the ground.",
    "See Wood panted forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\nand strapping it down safely.",
    "The Bludgers rocket around trying to\nknock players off their brooms.",
    "Thats why you have two Beaters on each\nteam  the Weasley twins are ours  its their job to protect their\nside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.",
    "So\n think youve got all that\n\nThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle the Keeper guards the\ngoal posts the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team Harry\nreeled off.",
    "Very good said Wood.",
    "Er  have the Bludgers ever killed anyone Harry asked hoping he\nsounded offhand.",
    "Never at Hogwarts.",
    "Weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\nthan that.",
    "Now the last member of the team is the\n\nSeeker.",
    "Thats you.",
    "And you dont have to worry about the Quaffle or the\nBludgers unless they crack my head open.",
    "Dont worry the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers  I\nmean theyre like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.",
    "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.",
    "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers it was tiny about the size\nof a large walnut.",
    "It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\nwings.",
    "This said Wood is the Golden Snitch and its the most important\nball of the lot.",
    "Its very hard to catch because its so fast and\ndifficult to see.",
    "Its the Seekers job to catch it.",
    "Youve got to weave\nin and out of the Chasers Beaters Bludgers and Quaffle to get it\nbefore the other teams Seeker because whichever Seeker catches the\nSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they\n\nnearly always win.",
    "Thats why Seekers get fouled so much.",
    "A game of\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught so it can go on for ages\n I think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on\nsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep.",
    "Well thats it  any\nquestions\n\nHarry shook his head.",
    "He understood what he had to do all right it was\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.",
    "We wont practice with the Snitch yet said Wood carefully shutting\nit back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it.",
    "Lets try\nyou out with a few of these.",
    "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\nminutes later he and Harry were up in the air Wood throwing the golf\nballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.",
    "Harry didnt miss a single one and Wood was delighted.",
    "After half an\nhour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on.",
    "That Quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said Wood happily\nas they trudged back up to the castle.",
    "I wouldnt be surprised if you\nturn out better than Charlie Weasley and he could have played for\nEngland if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons.",
    "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with Quidditch practice\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework but Harry could hardly\nbelieve it when he realized that hed already been at Hogwarts two\nmonths.",
    "The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.",
    "His\nlessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\nmastered the basics.",
    "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\nwafting through the corridors.",
    "Even better Professor Flitwick announced\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly\nsomething they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make\nNevilles toad zoom around the classroom.",
    "Professor Flitwick put the\nclass into pairs to practice.",
    "Harrys partner was Seamus Finnigan which\nwas a relief because Neville had been trying to catch his eye.",
    "Ron\nhowever was to be working with Hermione Granger.",
    "It was hard to tell\nwhether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.",
    "She hadnt spoken to\neither of them since the day Harrys broomstick had arrived.",
    "Now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as\nusual.",
    "Swish and flick remember swish and flick.",
    "And saying the magic\nwords properly is very important too  never forget Wizard Baruffio\nwho said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a\nbuffalo on his chest.",
    "It was very difficult.",
    "Harry and Seamus swished and flicked but the\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\ndesktop.",
    "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and\nset fire to it  Harry had to put it out with his hat.",
    "Ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck.",
    "Wingardium Leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill.",
    "Youre saying it wrong Harry heard Hermione snap.",
    "Its Winggardium\nLeviosa make the gar nice and long.",
    "You do it then if youre so clever Ron snarled.",
    "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said\nWingardium Leviosa\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\nheads.",
    "Oh well done cried Professor Flitwick clapping.",
    "Everyone see here\nMiss Grangers done it\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.",
    "Its no wonder no\none can stand her he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the\ncrowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly.",
    "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him.",
    "It was Hermione.",
    "Harry caught a glimpse of her face  and was startled to see that she\nwas in tears.",
    "I think she heard you.",
    "So said Ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable.",
    "She mustve noticed\nshes got no friends.",
    "Hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all\nafternoon.",
    "On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast\nHarry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that\nHermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone.",
    "Ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had\nentered the Great Hall where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out\nof their minds.",
    "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\nthousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the\ncandles in the pumpkins stutter.",
    "The feast appeared suddenly on the\ngolden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet.",
    "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\ncame sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face.",
    "Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair slumped\nagainst the table and gasped Troll  in the dungeons  thought you\nought to know.",
    "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.",
    "There was an uproar.",
    "It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\nthe end of Professor Dumbledores wand to bring silence.",
    "Prefects he rumbled lead your Houses back to the dormitories\nimmediately\n\nPercy was in his element.",
    "Follow me Stick together first years No need to fear the troll if\nyou follow my orders Stay close behind me now.",
    "Make way first years\ncoming through Excuse me Im a prefect\n\nHow could a troll get in Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.",
    "Dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said Ron.",
    "Maybe\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.",
    "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.",
    "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry\nsuddenly grabbed Rons arm.",
    "Ive just thought  Hermione.",
    "What about her\n\nShe doesnt know about the troll.",
    "Ron bit his lip.",
    "Oh all right he snapped.",
    "But Percyd better not see us.",
    "Ducking down they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way slipped\ndown a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls\nbathroom.",
    "They had just turned the corner when they heard quick\nfootsteps behind them.",
    "Percy hissed Ron pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.",
    "Peering around it however they saw not Percy but Snape.",
    "He crossed the\ncorridor and disappeared from view.",
    "Whats he doing Harry whispered.",
    "Why isnt he down in the dungeons\nwith the rest of the teachers\n\nSearch me.",
    "Quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after Snapes\nfading footsteps.",
    "Hes heading for the third floor Harry said but Ron held up his\nhand.",
    "Can you smell something\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.",
    "And then they heard it  a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of\ngigantic feet.",
    "Ron pointed  at the end of a passage to the left\nsomething huge was moving toward them.",
    "They shrank into the shadows and\nwatched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.",
    "It was a horrible sight.",
    "Twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite\ngray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\nperched on top like a coconut.",
    "It had short legs thick as tree trunks\nwith flat horny feet.",
    "The smell coming from it was incredible.",
    "It was\nholding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its\narms were so long.",
    "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.",
    "It waggled its\nlong ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room.",
    "The keys in the lock Harry muttered.",
    "We could lock it in.",
    "Good idea said Ron nervously.",
    "They edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt\nabout to come out of it.",
    "With one great leap Harry managed to grab the\nkey slam the door and lock it.",
    "Yes\n\nFlushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but\nas they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts\nstop  a high petrified scream  and it was coming from the chamber\ntheyd just chained up.",
    "Oh no said Ron pale as the Bloody Baron.",
    "Its the girls bathroom Harry gasped.",
    "Hermione they said together.",
    "It was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have\nWheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key\nfumbling in their panic.",
    "Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.",
    "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if\nshe was about to faint.",
    "The troll was advancing on her knocking the\nsinks off the walls as it went.",
    "Confuse it Harry said desperately to Ron and seizing a tap he\nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall.",
    "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.",
    "It lumbered around blinking\nstupidly to see what had made the noise.",
    "Its mean little eyes saw\nHarry.",
    "It hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it\nwent.",
    "Oy peabrain yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber and he\nthrew a metal pipe at it.",
    "The troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe\nhitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning\nits ugly snout toward Ron instead giving Harry time to run around it.",
    "Come on run run Harry yelled at Hermione trying to pull her toward\nthe door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall\nher mouth open with terror.",
    "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.",
    "It\nroared again and started toward Ron who was nearest and had no way to\nescape.",
    "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid He\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the\ntrolls neck from behind.",
    "The troll couldnt feel Harry hanging there\nbut even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\nnose and Harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped  it\nhad gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils.",
    "Howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with Harry\nclinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him\noff or catch him a terrible blow with the club.",
    "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright Ron pulled out his own wand \nnot knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell\nthat came into his head Wingardium Leviosa\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into\nthe air turned slowly over  and dropped with a sickening crack onto\nits owners head.",
    "The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its\nface with a thud that made the whole room tremble.",
    "Harry got to his feet.",
    "He was shaking and out of breath.",
    "Ron was\nstanding there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done.",
    "It was Hermione who spoke first.",
    "Is it  dead\n\nI dont think so said Harry I think its just been knocked out.",
    "He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose.",
    "It was covered\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue.",
    "Urgh  troll boogers.",
    "He wiped it on the trolls trousers.",
    "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.",
    "They hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course\nsomeone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars.",
    "A\nmoment later Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room\nclosely followed by Snape with Quirrell bringing up the rear.",
    "Quirrell\ntook one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly\ndown on a toilet clutching his heart.",
    "Snape bent over the troll.",
    "Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\nHarry.",
    "Harry had never seen her look so angry.",
    "Her lips were white.",
    "Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harrys\nmind.",
    "What on earth were you thinking of said Professor McGonagall with\ncold fury in her voice.",
    "Harry looked at Ron who was still standing with\nhis wand in the air.",
    "Youre lucky you werent killed.",
    "Why arent you in\nyour dormitory\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift piercing look.",
    "Harry looked at the floor.",
    "He\nwished Ron would put his wand down.",
    "Then a small voice came out of the shadows.",
    "Please Professor McGonagall  they were looking for me.",
    "Miss Granger\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.",
    "I went looking for the troll because I  I thought I could deal with it\non my own  you know because Ive read all about them.",
    "Ron dropped his wand.",
    "Hermione Granger telling a downright lie to a\nteacher If they hadnt found me Id be dead now.",
    "Harry stuck his wand\nup its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.",
    "They didnt have\ntime to come and fetch anyone.",
    "It was about to finish me off when they\narrived.",
    "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them.",
    "Well  in that case... said Professor McGonagall staring at the\nthree of them Miss Granger you foolish girl how could you think of\ntackling a mountain troll on your own\n\nHermione hung her head.",
    "Harry was speechless.",
    "Hermione was the last\nperson to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending\nshe had to get them out of trouble.",
    "It was as if Snape had started\nhanding out sweets.",
    "Miss Granger five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this said\nProfessor McGonagall.",
    "Im very disappointed in you.",
    "If youre not hurt\nat all youd better get off to Gryffindor tower.",
    "Students are finishing\nthe feast in their houses.",
    "Hermione left.",
    "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.",
    "Well I still say you were lucky but not many first years could have\ntaken on a fullgrown mountain troll.",
    "You each win Gryffindor five\npoints.",
    "Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.",
    "You may go.",
    "They hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had\nclimbed two floors up.",
    "It was a relief to be away from the smell of the\ntroll quite apart from anything else.",
    "We should have gotten more than ten points Ron grumbled.",
    "Five you mean once shes taken off Hermiones.",
    "Good of her to get us out of trouble like that Ron admitted.",
    "Mind\nyou we did save her.",
    "She might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with\nher Harry reminded him.",
    "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.",
    "Pig snout they said and entered.",
    "The common room was packed and noisy.",
    "Everyone was eating the food that\nhad been sent up.",
    "Hermione however stood alone by the door waiting\nfor them.",
    "There was a very embarrassed pause.",
    "Then none of them looking\nat each other they all said Thanks and hurried off to get plates.",
    "But from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend.",
    "There are\nsome things you cant share without ending up liking each other and\nknocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them.",
    "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nQUIDDITCH\n\nAs they entered November the weather turned very cold.",
    "The mountains\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.",
    "Every\nmorning the ground was covered in frost.",
    "Hagrid could be seen from the\nupstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field bundled\nup in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous\nbeaverskin boots.",
    "The Quidditch season had begun.",
    "On Saturday Harry would be playing in\nhis first match after weeks of training Gryffindor versus Slytherin.",
    "If\nGryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house\nchampionship.",
    "Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that as\ntheir secret weapon Harry should be kept well secret.",
    "But the news\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow and Harry didnt know\nwhich was worse  people telling him hed be brilliant or people\ntelling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.",
    "It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend.",
    "He didnt\nknow how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what\nwith all the lastminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.",
    "She\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages which turned out to be a\nvery interesting read.",
    "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\nmatch in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\nplayers and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\nthem that although people rarely died playing Quidditch referees had\nbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.",
    "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer\nfor it.",
    "The day before Harrys first Quidditch match the three of them\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.",
    "They were standing with their backs to it getting warm when Snape\ncrossed the yard.",
    "Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.",
    "Harry\nRon and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view\nthey were sure it wouldnt be allowed.",
    "Unfortunately something about\ntheir guilty faces caught Snapes eye.",
    "He limped over.",
    "He hadnt seen\nthe fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\nanyway.",
    "Whats that youve got there Potter\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages.",
    "Harry showed him.",
    "Library books are not to be taken outside the school said Snape.",
    "Give it to me.",
    "Five points from Gryffindor.",
    "Hes just made that rule up Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\naway.",
    "Wonder whats wrong with his leg\n\nDunno but I hope its really hurting him said Ron bitterly.",
    "The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening.",
    "Harry Ron and\nHermione sat together next to a window.",
    "Hermione was checking Harry and\nRons Charms homework for them.",
    "She would never let them copy How will\nyou learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right\nanswers anyway.",
    "Harry felt restless.",
    "He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back to take\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow.",
    "Why should he be afraid of\nSnape Getting up he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\nhe could have it.",
    "Better you than me they said together but Harry had an idea that\nSnape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening.",
    "He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.",
    "There was no answer.",
    "He knocked again.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Perhaps Snape had left the book in there It was worth a try.",
    "He pushed\nthe door ajar and peered inside  and a horrible scene met his eyes.",
    "Snape and Filch were inside alone.",
    "Snape was holding his robes above\nhis knees.",
    "One of his legs was bloody and mangled.",
    "Filch was handing\nSnape bandages.",
    "Blasted thing Snape was saying.",
    "How are you supposed to keep your\neyes on all three heads at once\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly but \n\nPOTTER\n\nSnapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\nhide his leg.",
    "Harry gulped.",
    "I just wondered if I could have my book back.",
    "GET OUT OUT\n\nHarry left before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.",
    "He\nsprinted back upstairs.",
    "Did you get it Ron asked as Harry joined them.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nIn a low whisper Harry told them what hed seen.",
    "You know what this means he finished breathlessly.",
    "He tried to get\npast that threeheaded dog at Halloween Thats where he was going when\nwe saw him  hes after whatever its guarding And Id bet my\nbroomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion\n\nHermiones eyes were wide.",
    "No  he wouldnt she said.",
    "I know hes not very nice but he\nwouldnt try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.",
    "Honestly Hermione you think all teachers are saints or something\nsnapped Ron.",
    "Im with Harry.",
    "I wouldnt put anything past Snape.",
    "But\nwhats he after Whats that dog guarding\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.",
    "Neville\nwas snoring loudly but Harry couldnt sleep.",
    "He tried to empty his mind\n he needed to sleep he had to he had his first Quidditch match in a\nfew hours  but the expression on Snapes face when Harry had seen his\nleg wasnt easy to forget.",
    "The next morning dawned very bright and cold.",
    "The Great Hall was full of\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of\neveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.",
    "Youve got to eat some breakfast.",
    "I dont want anything.",
    "Just a bit of toast wheedled Hermione.",
    "Im not hungry.",
    "Harry felt terrible.",
    "In an hours time hed be walking onto the field.",
    "Harry you need your strength said Seamus Finnigan.",
    "Seekers are\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.",
    "Thanks Seamus said Harry watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\nsausages.",
    "By eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\nthe Quidditch pitch.",
    "Many students had binoculars.",
    "The seats might be\nraised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going\non sometimes.",
    "Ron and Hermione joined Neville Seamus and Dean the West Ham fan up in\nthe top row.",
    "As a surprise for Harry they had painted a large banner on\none of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.",
    "It said Potter for President and\nDean who was good at drawing had done a large Gryffindor lion\nunderneath.",
    "Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\nthe paint flashed different colors.",
    "Meanwhile in the locker room Harry and the rest of the team were\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes Slytherin would be playing\nin green.",
    "Wood cleared his throat for silence.",

    "This is the best team Gryffindors had\nin years.",
    "Were going to win.",
    "I know it.",
    "He glared at them all as if to say Or else.",
    "Right.",
    "Its time.",
    "Good luck all of you.",
    "Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and hoping his\nknees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers.",
    "Madam Hooch was refereeing.",
    "She stood in the middle of the field waiting\nfor the two teams her broom in her hand.",
    "Now I want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all\ngathered around her.",
    "Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint a sixth year.",
    "Harry\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him.",
    "Out of the\ncorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing\nPotter for President over the crowd.",
    "His heart skipped.",
    "He felt braver.",
    "Mount your brooms please.",
    "Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.",

    "We dont want you attacked before you have to be.",
    "When Angelina had scored Harry had done a couple of looptheloops to\nlet off his feelings.",
    "Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.",
    "Once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys wristwatches and once a Bludger decided to\ncome pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but Harry\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.",
    "All right there Harry he had time to yell as he beat the Bludger\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.",
    "Slytherin in possession Lee Jordan was saying Chaser Pucey ducks\ntwo Bludgers two Weasleys and Chaser Bell and speeds toward the \nwait a moment  was that the Snitch\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle too\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his\nleft ear.",
    "Harry saw it.",
    "In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\nstreak of gold.",

    "So  after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\n\nJordan growled Professor McGonagall.",
    "I mean after that open and revolting foul\n\nJordan Im warning you \n\nAll right all right.",
    "Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker which\ncould happen to anyone Im sure so a penalty to Gryffindor taken by\nSpinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play Gryffindor\nstill in possession.",
    "It was as Harry dodged another Bludger which went spinning dangerously\npast his head that it happened.",

    "Before Ron could say another word Hermione had disappeared.",
    "Ron turned\nthe binoculars back on Harry.",
    "His broom was vibrating so hard it was\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer.",
    "The whole crowd was on\nits feet watching terrified as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull\nHarry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good  every time\nthey got near him the broom would jump higher still.",
    "They dropped lower\nand circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.",

    "Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the\nhem of Snapes robes.",
    "It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.",
    "A sudden yelp told her she had done her job.",
    "Scooping the fire off him\ninto a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row \nSnape would never know what had happened.",
    "It was enough.",
    "Up in the air Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\nto his broom.",
    "Neville you can look Ron said.",

    "Ive got the Snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the\ngame ended in complete confusion.",
    "He didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it Flint was still howling\ntwenty minutes later but it made no difference  Harry hadnt broken\nany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results \nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.",
    "Harry\nheard none of this though.",
    "He was being made a cup of strong tea back\nin Hagrids hut with Ron and Hermione.",
    "It was Snape Ron was explaining Hermione and I saw him.",
    "He was\ncursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you.",

    "The afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\nSnape.",
    "I know a jinx when I see one Hagrid Ive read all about them\n\nYouve got to keep eye contact and Snape wasnt blinking at all I saw\nhim\n\nIm tellin yeh yer wrong said Hagrid hotly.",

    "While the Gryffindor common\nroom and the Great Hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.",
    "Worst of all were Professor Snapes classes down in the dungeons where\ntheir breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as\npossible to their hot cauldrons.",
    "I do feel so sorry said Draco Malfoy one Potions class for all\nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyre\nnot wanted at home.",

    "The library said Hagrid following them out of the hall.",
    "Just before\nthe holidays Bit keen arent yeh\n\nOh were not working Harry told him brightly.",
    "Ever since you\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel weve been trying to find out who he is.",
    "You what Hagrid looked shocked.",
    "Listen here  Ive told yeh  drop\nit.",
    "Its nothin to you what that dogs guardin.",
    "We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is thats all said Hermione.",
    "Unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble Harry added.",
    "We\nmustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him\nanywhere  just give us a hint  I know Ive read his name somewhere.",
    "Im sayin nothin said Hagrid flatly.",
    "Just have to find out for ourselves then said Ron and they left\nHagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.",
    "They had indeed been searching books for Flamels name ever since Hagrid\nhad let it slip because how else were they going to find out what Snape\nwas trying to steal The trouble was it was very hard to know where to\nbegin not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\nbook.",
    "He wasnt in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century or Notable\nMagical Names of Our Time he was missing too from Important Modern\nMagical Discoveries and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.",
    "And\nthen of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of\nthousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows.",
    "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them\noff the shelves at random.",
    "Harry wandered over to the Restricted\nSection.",
    "He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasnt somewhere in\nthere.",
    "Unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never\nget one.",
    "These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never\ntaught at Hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced\nDefense Against the Dark Arts.",
    "What are you looking for boy\n\nNothing said Harry.",
    "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.",
    "Youd better get out then.",
    "Go on  out\n\nWishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story Harry left\nthe library.",
    "He Ron and Hermione had already agreed theyd better not\nask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.",
    "They were sure shed be\nable to tell them but they couldnt risk Snape hearing what they were\nup to.",
    "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\nanything but he wasnt very hopeful.",
    "They had been looking for two\nweeks after A but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\nwasnt surprising theyd found nothing.",
    "What they really needed was a\nnice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.",
    "Five minutes later Ron and Hermione joined him shaking their heads.",
    "They went off to lunch.",
    "You will keep looking while Im away wont you said Hermione.",
    "And\nsend me an owl if you find anything.",
    "And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is said Ron.",
    "Itd be safe to ask them.",
    "Very safe as theyre both dentists said Hermione.",
    "Once the holidays had started Ron and Harry were having too good a time\nto think much about Flamel.",
    "They had the dormitory to themselves and the\ncommon room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the\ngood armchairs by the fire.",
    "They sat by the hour eating anything they\ncould spear on a toasting fork  bread English muffins marshmallows\n and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled which were fun to talk\nabout even if they wouldnt work.",
    "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.",
    "This was exactly like\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot\nlike directing troops in battle.",
    "Rons set was very old and battered.",
    "Like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in\nhis family  in this case his grandfather.",
    "However old chessmen\nwerent a drawback at all.",
    "Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\ngetting them to do what he wanted.",
    "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him and they didnt\ntrust him at all.",
    "He wasnt a very good player yet and they kept\nshouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing.",
    "Dont\nsend me there cant you see his knight Send him we can afford to lose\nhim.",
    "On Christmas Eve Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\nday for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all.",
    "When he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.",
    "Merry Christmas said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\npulled on his bathrobe.",
    "You too said Harry.",
    "Will you look at this Ive got some presents\n\nWhat did you expect turnips said Ron turning to his own pile which\nwas a lot bigger than Harrys.",
    "Harry picked up the top parcel.",
    "It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\nscrawled across it was To Harry from Hagrid.",
    "Inside was a roughly cut\nwooden flute.",
    "Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself.",
    "Harry blew it \nit sounded a bit like an owl.",
    "A second very small parcel contained a note.",
    "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.",
    "From Uncle\nVernon and Aunt Petunia.",
    "Taped to the note was a fiftypence piece.",
    "Thats friendly said Harry.",
    "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.",
    "Weird he said NMat a shape This is money\n\nYou can keep it said Harry laughing at how pleased Ron was.",
    "Hagrid\nand my aunt and uncle  so who sent these\n\nI think I know who that ones from said Ron turning a bit pink and\npointing to a very lumpy parcel.",
    "My mom.",
    "I told her you didnt expect\nany presents and  oh no he groaned shes made you a Weasley\nsweater.",
    "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.",
    "Every year she makes us a sweater said Ron unwrapping his own and\nmines always maroon.",
    "Thats really nice of her said Harry trying the fudge which was\nvery tasty.",
    "His next present also contained candy  a large box of Chocolate Frogs\nfrom Hermione.",
    "This only left one parcel.",
    "Harry picked it up and felt it.",
    "It was very\nlight.",
    "He unwrapped it.",
    "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\nlay in gleaming folds.",
    "Ron gasped.",
    "Ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of\nEvery Flavor Beans hed gotten from Hermione.",
    "If thats what I think it\nis  theyre really rare and really valuable.",
    "What is it\n\nHarry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor.",
    "It was strange to\nthe touch like water woven into material.",
    "Its an invisibility cloak said Ron a look of awe on his face.",
    "Im\nsure it is  try it on.",
    "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.",
    "It is Look down\n\nHarry looked down at his feet but they were gone.",
    "He dashed to the\nmirror.",
    "Sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head\nsuspended in midair his body completely invisible.",
    "He pulled the cloak\nover his head and his reflection vanished completely.",
    "Theres a note said Ron suddenly.",
    "A note fell out of it\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.",
    "Written in narrow\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words Your\nfather left this in my possession before he died.",
    "It is time it was\nreturned to you.",
    "Use it well.",
    "A Very Merry Christmas to you.",
    "There was no signature.",
    "Harry stared at the note.",
    "Ron was admiring the\ncloak.",
    "Id give anything for one of these he said.",
    "Anything.",
    "Whats the\nmatter\n\nNothing said Harry.",
    "He felt very strange.",
    "Who had sent the cloak Had\nit really once belonged to his father\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.",
    "Harry stuffed the cloak\nquickly out of sight.",
    "He didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else\nyet.",
    "Merry Christmas\n\nHey look  Harrys got a Weasley sweater too\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow F on\nit the other a G.\n\nHarrys is better than ours though said Fred holding up Harrys\nsweater.",
    "She obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family.",
    "Why arent you wearing yours Ron George demanded.",
    "Come on get it\non theyre lovely and warm.",
    "I hate maroon Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.",
    "You havent got a letter on yours George observed.",
    "I suppose she\nthinks you dont forget your name.",
    "But were not stupid  we know were\ncalled Gred and Forge.",
    "Whats all th is noise.",
    "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving.",
    "He\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too\ncarried a lumpy sweater over his arm which\n\nFred seized.",
    "P for prefect Get it on Percy come on were all wearing ours even\nHarry got one.",
    "I  dont  want said Percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater\nover his head knocking his glasses askew.",
    "And youre not sitting with the prefects today either said\n\nGeorge.",
    "Christmas is a time for family.",
    "They frogmarched Percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by\nhis sweater.",
    "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner.",
    "A hundred\nfat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of\nchipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy\nand cranberry sauce  and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet\nalong the table.",
    "These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought with their little\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.",
    "Harry pulled a wizard\ncracker with Fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the\ninside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice.",
    "Up at\nthe High Table Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a\nflowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\nhad just read him.",
    "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.",
    "Percy nearly broke his\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice.",
    "Harry watched Hagrid\ngetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek who to Harrys\namazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided.",
    "When Harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of\nthings out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous\nballoons a GrowYourOwnWarts kit and his own new wizard chess set.",
    "The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\ngoing to end up as Mrs. Norriss Christmas dinner.",
    "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\nfight on the grounds.",
    "Then cold wet and gasping for breath they\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room where Harry broke in\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.",
    "He suspected he\nwouldnt have lost so badly if Percy hadnt tried to help him so much.",
    "After a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and Christmas cake\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and\nwatch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because\ntheyd stolen his prefect badge.",
    "It had been Harrys best Christmas day ever.",
    "Yet something had been\nnagging at the back of his mind all day.",
    "Not until he climbed into bed\nwas he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had\nsent it.",
    "Ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him\nfell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his\nfourposter.",
    "Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\ncloak out from under it.",
    "His fathers... this had been his fathers.",
    "He let the material flow\nover his hands smoother than silk light as air.",
    "Use it well the note\nhad said.",
    "He had to try it now.",
    "He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\naround himself.",
    "Looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and\nshadows.",
    "It was a very funny feeling.",
    "Use it well.",
    "Suddenly Harry felt wideawake.",
    "The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\nin this cloak.",
    "Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the\ndark and silence.",
    "He could go anywhere in this anywhere and Filch\nwould never know.",
    "Ron grunted in his sleep.",
    "Should Harry wake him Something held him back\n his fathers cloak  he felt that this time  the first time  he\nwanted to use it alone.",
    "He crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room\nand climbed through the portrait hole.",
    "Whos there squawked the Fat Lady.",
    "Harry said nothing.",
    "He walked\nquickly down the corridor.",
    "Where should he go He stopped his heart racing and thought.",
    "And then\nit came to him.",
    "The Restricted Section in the library.",
    "Hed be able to\nread as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.",
    "He set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\nwalked.",
    "The library was pitchblack and very eerie.",
    "Harry lit a lamp to see his\nway along the rows of books.",
    "The lamp looked as if it was floating along\nin midair and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it the\nsight gave him the creeps.",
    "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.",
    "Step ping\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\nlibrary he held up his lamp to read the titles.",
    "They didnt tell him much.",
    "Their peeling faded gold letters spelled\nwords in languages Harry couldnt understand.",
    "Some had no title at all.",
    "One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.",
    "The\nhairs on the back of Harrys neck prickled.",
    "Maybe he was imagining it\nmaybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books\nas though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be.",
    "He had to start somewhere.",
    "Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.",
    "A large\nblack and silver volume caught his eye.",
    "He pulled it out with\ndifficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee\nlet it fall open.",
    "A piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence  the book was\nscreaming Harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one\nhigh unbroken earsplitting note.",
    "He stumbled backward and knocked over\nhis lamp which went out at once.",
    "Panicking he heard footsteps coming\ndown the corridor outside  stuffing the shrieking book back on the\nshelf he ran for it.",
    "He passed Filch in the doorway Filchs pale wild\neyes looked straight through him and Harry slipped under Filchs\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks\nstill ringing in his ears.",
    "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.",
    "He had been\nso busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where\nhe was going.",
    "Perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he\nwas at all.",
    "There was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he\nmust be five floors above there.",
    "You asked me to come directly to you Professor if anyone was\nwandering around at night and somebodys been in the library Restricted\nSection.",
    "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face.",
    "Wherever he was Filch must\nknow a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and\nto his horror it was Snape who replied The Restricted Section Well\nthey cant be far well catch them.",
    "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\nahead.",
    "They couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor\nand if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him  the cloak\ndidnt stop him from being solid.",
    "He backed away as quietly as he could.",
    "A door stood ajar to his left.",
    "It\nwas his only hope.",
    "He squeezed through it holding his breath trying\nnot to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room\nwithout their noticing anything.",
    "They walked straight past and Harry\nleaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps\ndying away.",
    "That had been close very close.",
    "It was a few seconds before\nhe noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.",
    "It looked like an unused classroom.",
    "The dark shapes of desks and chairs\nwere piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper\nbasket  but propped against the wall facing him was something that\ndidnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone\nhad just put it there to keep it out of the way.",
    "It was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold\nframe standing on two clawed feet.",
    "There was an inscription carved\naround the top Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.",
    "His panic\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape Harry moved\nnearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\nagain.",
    "He stepped in front of it.",
    "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.",
    "He\nwhirled around.",
    "His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\nbook had screamed  for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but\na whole crowd of people standing right behind him.",
    "But the room was empty.",
    "Breathing very fast he turned slowly back to\nthe mirror.",
    "There he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there\nreflected behind him were at least ten others.",
    "Harry looked over his\nshoulder  but still no one was there.",
    "Or were they all invisible\ntoo Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors\ntrick was that it reflected them invisible or not\n\nHe looked in the mirror again.",
    "A woman standing right behind his\nreflection was smiling at him and waving.",
    "He reached out a hand and felt\nthe air behind him.",
    "If she was really there hed touch her their\nreflections were so close together but he felt only air  she and the\nothers existed only in the mirror.",
    "She was a very pretty woman.",
    "She had dark red hair and her eyes  her\neyes are just like mine Harry thought edging a little closer to the\nglass.",
    "Bright green  exactly the same shape but then he noticed that\nshe was crying smiling but crying at the same time.",
    "The tall thin\nblackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her.",
    "He wore\nglasses and his hair was very untidy.",
    "It stuck up at the back just as\nHarrys did.",
    "Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\nthat of his reflection.",
    "Mom he whispered.",
    "Dad\n\nThey just looked at him smiling.",
    "And slowly Harry looked into the\nfaces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green\neyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as\nthough he had Harrys knobbly knees  Harry was looking at his family\nfor the first time in his life.",
    "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\nthem his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping\nto fall right through it and reach them.",
    "He had a powerful kind of ache\ninside him half joy half terrible sadness.",
    "How long he stood there he didnt know.",
    "The reflections did not fade\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his\nsenses.",
    "He couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed.",
    "He\ntore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered Ill come back\nand hurried from the room.",
    "You could have woken me up said Ron crossly.",
    "You can come tonight Im going back I want to show you the mirror.",
    "Id like to see your mom and dad Ron said eagerly.",
    "And I want to see all your family all the Weasleys youll be able to\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.",
    "You can see them any old time said Ron.",
    "Just come round my house\nthis summer.",
    "Anyway maybe it only shows dead people.",
    "Shame about not\nfinding Flamel though.",
    "Have some bacon or something why arent you\neating anything\n\nHarry couldnt eat.",
    "He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\nagain tonight.",
    "He had almost forgotten about Flamel.",
    "It didnt seem very\nimportant anymore.",
    "Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding\nWhat did it matter if Snape stole it really\n\nAre you all right said Ron.",
    "You look odd.",
    "What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\nroom again.",
    "With Ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much\nmore slowly the next night.",
    "They tried retracing Harrys route from the\nlibrary wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.",
    "Im freezing said Ron.",
    "Lets forget it and go back.",
    "No Harry hissed.",
    "I know its here somewhere.",
    "They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction\nbut saw no one else.",
    "just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead\nwith cold Harry spotted the suit of armor.",
    "Its here  just here  yes\n\nThey pushed the door open.",
    "Harry dropped the cloak from around his\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.",
    "There they were.",
    "His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.",
    "See Harry whispered.",
    "I cant see anything.",
    "Look Look at them all... there are loads of them....",
    "I can only see you.",
    "Look in it properly go on stand where I am.",
    "Harry stepped aside but with Ron in front of the mirror he couldnt\nsee his family anymore just Ron in his paisley pajamas.",
    "Ron though was staring transfixed at his image.",
    "Look at me he said.",
    "Can you see all your family standing around you\n\nNo  Im alone  but Im different  I look older  and Im head\nboy\n\nWhat\n\nI am  Im wearing the badge like Bill used to  and Im holding the\nhouse cup and the Quidditch cup  Im Quidditch captain too.",
    "Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\nHarry.",
    "Do you think this mirror shows the future\n\nHow can it All my family are dead  let me have another look \n\nYou had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time.",
    "Youre only holding the Quidditch cup whats interesting about that I\nwant to see my parents.",
    "Dont push me \n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.",
    "They hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking.",
    "Quick\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\ncame round the door.",
    "Ron and Harry stood quite still both thinking the\nsame thing  did the cloak work on cats After what seemed an age she\nturned and left.",
    "This isnt safe  she might have gone for Filch I bet she heard us.",
    "Come on.",
    "And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.",
    "The snow still hadnt melted the next morning.",
    "Want to play chess Harry said Ron.",
    "No.",
    "Why dont we go down and visit Hagrid\n\nNo... you go...",
    "I know what youre thinking about Harry that mirror.",
    "Dont go back\ntonight.",
    "Why not\n\nI dunno Ive just got a bad feeling about it  and anyway youve had\ntoo many close shaves already.",
    "Filch Snape and Mrs. Norris are\nwandering around.",
    "So what if they cant see you What if they walk into\nyou What if you knock something over\n\nYou sound like Hermione.",
    "Im serious Harry dont go.",
    "But Harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in\nfront of the mirror and Ron wasnt going to stop him.",
    "That third night he found his way more quickly than before.",
    "He was\nwalking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he\ndidnt meet anyone.",
    "And there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of\nhis grandfathers nodding happily.",
    "Harry sank down to sit on the floor in\nfront of the mirror.",
    "There was nothing to stop him from staying here all\nnight with his family.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Except \n\nSo  back again Harry\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.",
    "He looked behind\nhim.",
    "Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus\nDumbledore.",
    "Harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to\nget to the mirror he hadnt noticed him.",
    "I didnt see you sir.",
    "Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said Dumbledore\nand Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.",
    "So said Dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\nHarry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of\nthe Mirror of Erised.",
    "I didnt know it was called that Sir.",
    "But I expect youve realized by now what it does\n\nIt  well  it shows me my family \n\nAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.",
    "How did you know \n\nI dont need a cloak to become invisible said Dumbledore gently.",
    "Now can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all\n\nHarry shook his head.",
    "Let me explain.",
    "The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it\nand see himself exactly as he is.",
    "Does that help\n\nHarry thought.",
    "Then he said slowly It shows us what we want...\nwhatever we want...",
    "Yes and no said Dumbledore quietly.",
    "It shows us nothing more or less\nthan the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts.",
    "You who have\nnever known your family see them standing around you.",
    "Ronald Weasley\nwho has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing\nalone the best of all of them.",
    "However this mirror will give us\nneither knowledge or truth.",
    "Men have wasted away before it entranced by\nwhat they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is\nreal or even possible.",
    "The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow Harry and I ask you\nnot to go looking for it again.",
    "If you ever do run across it you will\nnow be prepared.",
    "It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live\nremember that.",
    "Now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and\nget off to bed\n\nHarry stood up.",
    "Sir  Professor Dumbledore Can I ask you something\n\nObviously youve just done so Dumbledore smiled.",
    "You may ask me one\nmore thing however.",
    "What do you see when you look in the mirror\n\nI I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks.",
    "Harry stared.",
    "One can never have enough socks said Dumbledore.",
    "Another Christmas\nhas come and gone and I didnt get a single pair.",
    "People will insist on\ngiving me books.",
    "It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore\nmight not have been quite truthful.",
    "But then he thought as he shoved\nScabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question.",
    "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nNICOLAS FLAMEL\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of\nErised again and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the\ninvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk.",
    "Harry\nwished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he\ncouldnt.",
    "He started having nightmares.",
    "Over and over again he dreamed\nabout his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high\nvoice cackled with laughter.",
    "You see Dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said\nRon when Harry told him about these drearns.",
    "Hermione who came back the day before term started took a different\nview of things.",
    "She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed roaming the school three nights in a row If Filch had\ncaught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who\nNicolas Flamel was.",
    "They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li brary\nbook even though Harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere.",
    "Once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten\nminutes during their breaks.",
    "Harry had even less time than the other\ntwo because Quidditch practice had started again.",
    "Wood was working the team harder than ever.",
    "Even the endless rain that\nhad replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits.",
    "The Weasleys\ncomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic but Harry was on Woods\nside.",
    "If they won their next match against Hufflepuff they would\novertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven\nyears.",
    "Quite apart from wanting to win Harry found that he had fewer\nnightmares when he was tired out after training.",
    "Then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session Wood gave\nthe team a bit of bad news.",
    "Hed just gotten very angry with the\nWeasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off\ntheir brooms.",
    "Will you stop messing around he yelled.",
    "Thats exactly the sort of\nthing thatll lose us the match Snapes refereeing this time and hell\nbe looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.",
    "Snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.",
    "Whens\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match Hes not going to be fair if we\nmight overtake Slytherin.",
    "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain too.",
    "Its not my fault said Wood.",
    "Weve just got to make sure we play a\nclean game so Snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us.",
    "Which was all very well thought Harry but he had another reason for\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....",
    "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\nend of practice but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common\nroom where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.",
    "Chess was the only\nthing Hermione ever lost at something Harry and Ron thought was very\ngood for her.",
    "Dont talk to me for a moment said Ron when Harry sat down next to\nhim I need to concen  He caught sight of Harrys face.",
    "Whats the\nmatter with you You look terrible.",
    "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear Harry told the other\ntwo about Snapes sudden sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.",
    "Dont play said Hermione at once.",
    "Say youre ill said Ron.",
    "Pretend to break your leg Hermione suggested.",
    "Really break your leg said Ron.",
    "I cant said Harry.",
    "There isnt a reserve Seeker.",
    "If I back out\nGryffindor cant play at all.",
    "At that moment Neville toppled into the common room.",
    "How he had managed\nto climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the\nLegLocker Curse.",
    "He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to\nGryffindor tower.",
    "Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione who leapt up and performed\nthe countercurse.",
    "Nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet\ntrembling.",
    "What happened Hermione asked him leading him over to sit\nwith Harry and Ron.",
    "Malfoy said Neville shakily.",
    "I met him outside the library.",
    "He said\nhed been looking for someone to practice that on.",
    "Go to Professor McGonagall Hermione urged Neville.",
    "Report him\n\nNeville shook his head.",
    "I dont want more trouble he mumbled.",
    "Youve got to stand up to him Neville said Ron.",
    "Hes used to\nwalking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of\nhim and make it easier.",
    "Theres no need to tell me Im not brave enough to be in Gryffindor\nMalfoys already done that Neville choked out.",
    "Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas.",
    "He\ngave it to Neville who looked as though he might cry.",
    "Youre worth twelve of Malfoy Harry said.",
    "The Sorting Hat chose you\nfor Gryffindor didnt it And wheres Malfoy In stinking Slytherin.",
    "Nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.",
    "Thanks Harry...",
    "I think Ill go to bed.... Dyou want the card you\ncollect them dont you\n\nAs Neville walked away Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.",
    "Dumbledore again he said He was the first one I ever\n\nHe gasped.",
    "He stared at the back of the card.",
    "Then he looked up at Ron\nand Hermione.",
    "Ive found him he whispered.",
    "Ive found Flamel I told you Id read\nthe name somewhere before I read it on the train coming here  listen\nto this Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark\nwizard Grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of\ndragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas\nFlamel\n\nHermione jumped to her feet.",
    "She hadnt looked so excited since theyd\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.",
    "Stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\ndormitories.",
    "Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks\nbefore she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms.",
    "I never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly.",
    "I got this\nout of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.",
    "Light said Ron but Hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked\nsomething up and started flicking frantically through the pages\nmuttering to herself.",
    "At last she found what she was looking for.",
    "I knew it I knew it\n\nAre we allowed to speak yet said Ron grumpily.",
    "Hermione ignored him.",
    "Nicolas Flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker\nof the Sorcerers Stone\n\nThis didnt have quite the effect shed expected.",
    "The what said Harry and Ron.",
    "Oh honestly dont you two read Look  read that there.",
    "She pushed the book toward them and Harry and Ron read The ancient\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerers Stone a\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers.",
    "The stone will transform\nany metal into pure gold.",
    "It also produces the Elixir of Life which\nwill make the drinker immortal.",
    "There have been many reports of the Sorcerers Stone over the centuries\nbut the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel\nthe noted alchemist and opera lover.",
    "Mr. Flamel who celebrated his six\nhundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in Devon\nwith his wife Perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight.",
    "See said Hermione when Harry and Ron had finished.",
    "The dog must be\nguarding Flamels Sorcerers Stone I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it\nsafe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it\nthats why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts\n\nA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said Harry.",
    "No\nwonder Snapes after it Anyone would want it.",
    "And no wonder we couldnt find Flamel in that Study of Recent\nDevelopments in Wizardry said Ron.",
    "Hes not exactly recent if hes\nsix hundred and sixtyfive is he\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts while copying down\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites Harry and Ron were still\ndiscussing what theyd do with a Sorcerers Stone if they had one.",
    "It\nwasnt until Ron said hed buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\nremembered about Snape and the coming match.",
    "Im going to play he told Ron and Hermione.",
    "If I dont all the\nSlytherins will think Im just too scared to face Snape.",
    "Ill show\nthem... itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.",
    "Just as long as were not wiping you off the field said Hermione.",
    "As the match drew nearer however Harry became more and more nervous\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione.",
    "The rest of the team wasnt too calm\neither.",
    "The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\nwonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed\nto with such a biased referee\n\nHarry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went.",
    "At times he even wondered\nwhether Snape was following him trying to catch him on his own.",
    "Potions\nlessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture Snape was so\nhorrible to Harry.",
    "Could Snape possibly know theyd found out about the\nSorcerers Stone Harry didnt see how he could  yet he sometimes had\nthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.",
    "Harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\nnext afternoon that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether theyd ever\nsee him alive again.",
    "This wasnt what youd call comforting.",
    "Harry\nhardly heard a word of Woods pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch\nrobes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.",
    "Ron and Hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to\nNeville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or\nwhy they had both brought their wands to the match.",
    "Little did Harry\nknow that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the LegLocker\nCurse.",
    "Theyd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville and were\nready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.",
    "Now dont forget its Locomotor Mortis Hermione muttered as Ron\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.",
    "I know Ron snapped.",
    "Dont nag.",
    "Back in the locker room Wood had taken Harry aside.",
    "Dont want to pressure you Potter but if we ever need an early\ncapture of the Snitch its now.",
    "Finish the game before Snape can favor\nHufflepuff too much.",
    "The whole schools out there said Fred Weasley peering out of the\ndoor.",
    "Even  blimey  Dumbledores come to watch\n\nHarrys heart did a somersault.",
    "Dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure.",
    "Fred was right.",
    "There was no mistaking that silver beard.",
    "Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe.",
    "There was\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\nwatching.",
    "Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\nonto the field something that Ron noticed too.",
    "Ive never seen Snape look so mean he told Hermione.",
    "Look theyre\noff Ouch\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head.",
    "It was Malfoy.",
    "Oh sorry Weasley didnt see you there.",
    "Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.",
    "Wonder how long Potters going to stay on his broom this time Anyone\nwant a bet What about you Weasley\n\nRon didnt answer Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\nGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.",
    "Hermione who had all her\nfingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at Harry who was\ncircling the game like a hawk looking for the Snitch.",
    "You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team said\nMalfoy loudly a few minutes later as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\npenalty for no reason at all.",
    "Its people they feel sorry for.",
    "See\ntheres Potter whos got no parents then theres the Weasleys whove\ngot no money  you should be on the team Longbottom youve got no\nbrains.",
    "Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.",
    "Im worth twelve of you Malfoy he stammered.",
    "Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter but Ron still not\ndaring to take his eyes from the game said You tell him Neville.",
    "Longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than Weasley and\nthats saying something.",
    "Rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\nabout Harry.",
    "Im warning you Malfoy  one more word\n\nRon said Hermione suddenly Harry \n\nWhat Where\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and\ncheers from the crowd.",
    "Hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her\nmouth as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.",
    "Youre in luck Weasley Potters obviously spotted some money on the\nground said Malfoy.",
    "Ron snapped.",
    "Before Malfoy knew what was happening Ron was on top of\nhim wrestling him to the ground.",
    "Neville hesitated then clambered over\nthe back of his seat to help.",
    "Come on Harry Hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as\nHarry sped straight at Snape  she didnt even notice Malfoy and Ron\nrolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the\nwhirl of fists that was Neville Crabbe and Goyle.",
    "Up in the air Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\nsomething scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches  the next\nsecond Harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the\nSnitch clasped in his hand.",
    "The stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember\nthe Snitch being caught so quickly.",
    "Ron Ron Where are you The games over Harrys won Weve won\nGryffindor is in the lead shrieked Hermione dancing up and down on\nher seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.",
    "Harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground.",
    "He couldnt believe\nit.",
    "Hed done it  the game was over it had barely lasted five\nminutes.",
    "As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw Snape land\nnearby whitefaced and tightlipped  then Harry felt a hand on his\nshoulder and looked up into Dumbledores smiling face.",
    "Well done said Dumbledore quietly so that only Harry could hear.",
    "Nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror... been keeping\nbusy... excellent...\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.",
    "Harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his Nimbus Two\nThousand back to the broomshed.",
    "He couldnt ever remember feeling\nhappier.",
    "Hed really done something to be proud of now  no one could\nsay he was just a famous name any more.",
    "The evening air had never\nsmelled so sweet.",
    "He walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour\nin his head which was a happy blur Gryffindors running to lift him\nonto their shoulders Ron and Hermione in the distance jumping up and\ndown Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.",
    "Harry had reached the shed.",
    "He leaned against the wooden door and looked\nup at Hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.",
    "Gryffindor in the lead.",
    "Hed done it hed shown Snape....\n\nAnd speaking of Snape...\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.",
    "Clearly\nnot wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the\nforbidden forest.",
    "Harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched.",
    "He\nrecognized the figures prowling walk.",
    "Snape sneaking into the forest\nwhile everyone else was at dinner  what was going on\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.",
    "Gliding\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.",
    "He\nfollowed.",
    "The trees were so thick he couldnt see where Snape had gone.",
    "He flew in\ncircles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he\nheard voices.",
    "He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering\nbeech tree.",
    "He climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his\nbroomstick trying to see through the leaves.",
    "Below in a shadowy\nclearing stood Snape but he wasnt alone.",
    "Quirrell was there too.",
    "Harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering\nworse than ever.",
    "Harry strained to catch what they were saying.",
    "... ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces\nSeverus...\n\nOh I thought wed keep this private said Snape his voice icy.",
    "Students arent supposed to know about the Sorcerers Stone after\nall.",
    "Harry leaned forward.",
    "Quirrell was mumbling something.",
    "Snape interrupted\nhim.",
    "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrids yet\n\nBbbut Severus I \n\nYou dont want me as your enemy Quirrell said Snape taking a step\ntoward him.",
    "II dont know what you\n\nYou know perfectly well what I mean.",
    "An owl hooted loudly and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.",
    "He steadied\nhimself in time to hear Snape say  your little bit of hocuspocus.",
    "Im waiting.",
    "Bbut I dddont \n\nVery well Snape cut in.",
    "Well have another little chat soon when\nyouve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties\nlie.",
    "He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.",
    "It was\nalmost dark now but Harry could see Quirrell standing quite still as\nthough he was petrified.",
    "Harry where have you been Hermione squeaked.",
    "We won You won We won shouted Ron thumping Harry on the back.",
    "And\nI gave Malfoy a black eye and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle\nsinglehanded Hes still out cold but Madam Pomftey says hell be all\nright  talk about showing Slytherin Everyones waiting for you in the\ncommon room were having a party Fred and George stole some cakes and\nstuff from the kitchens.",
    "Never mind that now said Harry breathlessly.",
    "Lets find an empty\nroom you wait til you hear this....",
    "He made sure Peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them\nthen he told them what hed seen and heard.",
    "So we were right it is the Sorcerers Stone and Snapes trying to\nforce Quirrell to help him get it.",
    "He asked if he knew how to get past\nFluffy  and he said something about Quirrells hocus pocuss I reckon\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy loads of\nenchantments probably and Quirrell would have done some antiDark Arts\nspell that Snape needs to break through \n\nSo you mean the Stones only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\nSnape said Hermione in alarm.",
    "Itll be gone by next Tuesday said Ron.",
    "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\nQuirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought.",
    "In the\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it\ndidnt look as though hed cracked yet.",
    "Every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor Harry Ron and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside.",
    "Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper\nwhich surely meant that the Stone was still safe.",
    "Whenever Harry passed\nQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and Ron\nhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrells stutter.",
    "Hermione however had more on her mind than the Sorcerers Stone.",
    "She\nhad started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.",
    "Harry and Ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the\nsame.",
    "Hermione the exams are ages away.",
    "Ten weeks Hermione snapped.",
    "Thats not ages thats like a second to\nNicolas Flamel.",

    "They piled so much homework on them that the Easter\nholidays werent nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.",
    "It was hard\nto relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons\nblood or practicing wand movements.",
    "Moaning and yawning Harry and Ron\nspent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get\nthrough all their extra work.",
    "Ill never remember this Ron burst out one afternoon throwing down\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window.",
    "It was the\nfirst really fine day theyd had in months.",
    "The sky was a clear\nforgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.",
    "Harry who was looking up Dittany in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\nFungi didnt look up until he heard Ron say Hagrid What are you\ndoing in the library\n\nHagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back.",

    "He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms\nand slammed them down on the table.",
    "Dragons he whispered.",
    "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons\nLook at these Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland From Egg to\nInferno A Dragon Keepers Guide.",
    "Hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time I ever\nmet him  said Harry.",
    "But its against our laws said Ron.",
    "Dragon breeding was outlawed by\nthe Warlocks Convention of 1709 everyone knows that.",

    "So what on earths Hagrid up to said Hermione.",
    "When they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later\nthey were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.",
    "Hagrid\ncalled Who is it before he let them in and then shut the door\nquickly behind them.",
    "It was stifling hot inside.",
    "Even though it was such a warm day there\nwas a blazing fire in the grate.",
    "Hagrid made them tea and offered them\nstoat sandwiches which they refused.",
    "So  yeh wanted to ask me somethin\n\nYes said Harry.",
    "There was no point beating around the bush.",
    "We were\nwondering if you could tell us whats guarding the Sorcerers Stone\napart from Fluffy.",
    "Hagrid frowned at him.",
    "0 course I cant he said.",

    "Hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was\nsmiling.",
    "We only wondered who had done the guarding really.",
    "Hermione\nwent on.",
    "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him\napart from you.",
    "Hagrids chest swelled at these last words.",
    "Harry and Ron beamed at\nHermione.",
    "Well I don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... lets see... he\nborrowed Fluffy from me... then some o the teachers did enchantments...",
    "Professor Sprout  Professor Flitwick  Professor McGonagall  he\nticked them off on his fingers Professor Quirrell  an Dumbledore\nhimself did somethin o course.",
    "Hang on Ive forgotten someone.",
    "Oh\nyeah Professor Snape.",
    "Snape\n\nYeah  yer not still on abou that are yeh Look Snape helped\nprotect the Stone hes not about ter steal it.",
    "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.",
    "If Snape\nhad been in on protecting the Stone it must have been easy to find out\nhow the other teachers had guarded it.",
    "He probably knew everything \nexcept it seemed Quirrells spell and how to get past Fluffy.",
    "Youre the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy.",
    "arent you\nHagrid said Harry anxiously.",
    "And you wouldnt tell anyone would you\nNot even one of the teachers\n\nNot a soul knows except me an Dumbledore said Hagrid proudly.",

    "In the very heart of the fire\nunderneath the kettle was a huge black egg.",
    "Ah said Hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard Thats er...\n\nWhere did you get it Hagrid said Ron crouching over the fire to get\na closer look at the egg.",
    "It mustve cost you a fortune.",
    "Won it said Hagrid.",
    "Las night.",

    "Hagrid you live in a wooden house she said.",
    "But Hagrid wasnt listening.",
    "He was humming merrily as he stoked the\nfire.",
    "So now they had something else to worry about what might happen to\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.",
    "Wonder what its like to have a peaceful life Ron sighed as evening\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were\ngetting.",
    "Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and\nRon too.",
    "It was driving them nuts.",
    "Then one breakfast time Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.",
    "He had written only two words Its hatching.",
    "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.",
    "Hermione\nwouldnt hear of it.",
    "Hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\nhatching\n\nWeve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what\nHagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing \n\nShut up Harry whispered.",
    "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.",
    "How\nmuch had he heard Harry didnt like the look on Malfoys face at all.",
    "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrids with the other two during\nmorning break.",
    "When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their\nlesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried\nthrough the grounds to the edge of the forest.",

    "There were deep cracks in it.",
    "Something\nwas moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it.",
    "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\nbreath.",
    "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.",
    "The baby\ndragon flopped onto the table.",
    "It wasnt exactly pretty Harry thought\nit looked like a crumpled black umbrella.",
    "Its spiny wings were huge\ncompared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils\nthe stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes.",

    "Whats the matter\n\nSomeone was lookin through the gap in the curtains  its a kid \nhes runnin back up ter the school.",
    "Harry bolted to the door and looked out.",
    "Even at a distance there was no\nmistaking him.",
    "Malfoy had seen the dragon.",
    "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoys face during the next week\nmade Harry Ron and Hermione very nervous.",

    "Charlie can take care of him and then put\nhim back in the wild\n\nBrilliant said Ron.",
    "How about it Hagrid\n\nAnd in the end Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\nask him.",
    "The following week dragged by.",
    "Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\nsitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to\nbed.",
    "The clock on the wall had just\n\nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open.",

    "Im not going to be able to hold a quill for a\nweek.",
    "I tell you that dragons the most horrible animal Ive ever met\nbut the way Hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little\nbunny rabbit.",
    "When it bit me he told me off for frightening it.",
    "And when\nI left he was singing it a lullaby.",
    "There was a tap on the dark window.",
    "Its Hedwig said Harry hurrying to let her in.",
    "Shell have\nCharlies answer\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.",
    "Dear Ron\n\nHow are you Thanks for the letter  Id be glad to take the Norwegian\nRidgeback but it wont be easy getting him here.",
    "I think the best thing\nwill be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to\nvisit me next week.",
    "Trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal\ndragon.",
    "Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on\nSaturday They can meet you there and take him away while its still\ndark.",
    "Send me an answer as soon as possible.",
    "Love\n\nCharlie\n\nThey looked at one another.",
    "Weve got the invisibility cloak said Harry.",
    "It shouldnt be too\ndifficult  I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and\nNorbert.",
    "It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\nagreed with him.",
    "Anything to get rid of Norbert  and Malfoy.",
    "There was a hitch.",
    "By the next morning Rons bitten hand had swollen to\ntwice its usual size.",

    "Its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its\nabout to fall off.",
    "Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of\nmy books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.",
    "He kept\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me  Ive told her it was a\ndog but I dont think she believes me I shouldnt have hit him at the\nQuidditch match thats why hes doing this.",
    "Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.",
    "Itll all be over at midnight on Saturday said Hermione but this\ndidnt soothe Ron at all.",
    "On the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke\ninto a sweat.",
    "Midnight on Saturday he said in a hoarse voice.",
    "Oh no oh no  Ive\njust remembered  Charlies letter was in that book Malfoy took hes\ngoing to know were getting rid of Norbert.",
    "Harry and Hermione didnt get a chance to answer.",
    "Madam Pomfrey came\nover at that moment and made them leave saying Ron needed sleep.",
    "Its too late to change the plan now Harry told Hermione.",
    "We havent\ngot time to send Charlie another owl and this could be our only chance\nto get rid of Norbert.",
    "Well have to risk it.",
    "And we have got the\ninvisibility cloak Malfoy doesnt know about that.",
    "They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid who opened a window to talk to them.",
    "I wont let you in he puffed.",
    "Norberts at a tricky stage  nothin\nI cant handle.",
    "When they told him about Charlies letter his eyes filled with tears\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the\nleg.",
    "Aargh Its all right he only got my boot  jus playin  hes only\na baby after all.",
    "The baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle.",
    "Harry\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldnt come\nquickly enough.",
    "They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\ngoodbye to Norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had\nto do.",
    "It was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis\nagainst the wall.",
    "Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.",
    "Hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said Hagrid in\na muffled voice.",
    "An Ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets\nlonely.",
    "From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.",
    "Byebye Norbert Hagrid sobbed as Harry and Hermione covered the\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.",
    "Mommy will never forget you\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never\nknew.",
    "Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble\nstaircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.",
    "UP another\nstaircase then another  even one of Harrys shortcuts didnt make the\nwork much easier.",
    "Nearly there Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\ntallest tower.",
    "Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.",
    "Forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the\nshadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each\nother ten feet away.",
    "A lamp flared.",
    "Professor McGonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had Malfoy by\nthe ear.",
    "Detention she shouted.",
    "And twenty points from Slytherin Wandering\naround in the middle of the night how dare you \n\nYou dont understand Professor.",
    "Harry Potters coming  hes got a\ndragon\n\nWhat utter rubbish How dare you tell such lies Come on  I shall see\nProfessor Snape about you Malfoy\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\nthing in the world after that.",
    "Not until theyd stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe\nproperly again.",
    "Hermione did a sort of jig.",
    "Malfoys got detention I could sing\n\nDont Harry advised her.",
    "Chuckling about Malfoy they waited Norbert thrashing about in his\ncrate.",
    "About ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out\nof the darkness.",
    "Charlies friends were a cheery lot.",
    "They showed Harry and Hermione the\nharness theyd rigged up so they could suspend Norbert between them.",
    "They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and\nHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.",
    "At last Norbert was going... going... gone.",
    "They slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as\ntheir hands now that Norbert was off them.",
    "No more dragon  Malfoy in\ndetention  what could spoil their happiness\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs.",
    "As they\nstepped into the corridor Filchs face loomed suddenly out of the\ndarkness.",
    "Well well well he whispered we are in trouble.",
    "Theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.",
    "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST\n\nThings couldnt have been worse.",
    "Filch took them down to Professor McGonagalls study on the first floor\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.",
    "Hermione\nwas trembling.",
    "Excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each\nother around Harrys brain each more feeble than the last.",
    "He couldnt\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time.",
    "They were\ncornered.",
    "How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak\nThere was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for\ntheir being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was\noutofbounds except for classes.",
    "Add Norbert and the invisibility\ncloak and they might as well be packing their bags already.",
    "Had Harry thought that things couldnt have been worse He was wrong.",
    "When Professor McGonagall appeared she was leading Neville.",
    "Harry Neville burst Out the moment he saw the other two.",
    "I was\ntrying to find you to warn you I heard Malfoy saying he was going to\ncatch you he said you had a drag \n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up but Professor\nMcGonagall had seen.",
    "She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert\nas she towered over the three of them.",
    "I would never have believed it of any of you.",
    "Mr. Filch says you were\nup in the astronomy tower.",
    "Its one oclock in the morning.",
    "Explain\nyourselves.",
    "It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers\nquestion.",
    "She was staring at her slippers as still as a statue.",
    "I think Ive got a good idea of whats been going on said Professor\nMcGonagall.",
    "It doesnt take a genius to work it out.",
    "You fed Draco\nMalfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of\nbed and into trouble.",
    "Ive already caught him.",
    "I suppose you think its\nfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it too\n\nHarry caught Nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this\nwasnt true because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.",
    "Poor\nblundering Neville  Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and\nfind them in the dark to warn them.",
    "Im disgusted said Professor McGonagall.",
    "Four students out of bed in\none night Ive never heard of such a thing before You Miss Granger I\nthought you had more sense.",
    "As for you Mr. Potter I thought Gryffindor\nmeant more to you than this.",
    "All three of you will receive detentions \nyes you too Mr. Longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around\nschool at night especially these days its very dangerous  and fifty\npoints will be taken from Gryffindor.",
    "Fifty Harry gasped  they would lose the lead the lead hed won in\nthe last Quidditch match.",
    "Fifty points each said Professor McGonagall breathing heavily\nthrough her long pointed nose.",
    "Professor  please\n\nYou cant \n\nDont tell me what I can and cant do Potter.",
    "Now get back to bed all\nof you.",
    "Ive never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.",
    "A hundred and fifty points lost.",
    "That put Gryffindor in last place.",
    "In\none night theyd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house\ncup.",
    "Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.",
    "How\ncould they ever make up for this\n\nHarry didnt sleep all night.",
    "He could hear Neville sobbing into his\npillow for what seemed like hours.",
    "Harry couldnt think of anything to\nsay to comfort him.",
    "He knew Neville like himself was dreading the\ndawn.",
    "What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what\ntheyd done\n\nAt first Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the\nhouse points the next day thought thered been a mistake.",
    "How could they\nsuddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday And then\nthe story started to spread Harry Potter the famous Harry Potter\ntheir hero of two Quidditch matches had lo st them all those points\nhim and a couple of other stupid first years.",
    "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school\nHarry was suddenly the most hated.",
    "Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs\nturned on him because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose\nthe house cup.",
    "Everywhere Harry went people pointed and didnt trouble\nto lower their voices as they insulted him.",
    "Slytherins on the other\nhand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering Thanks\nPotter we owe you one\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.",
    "Theyll all forget this in a few weeks.",
    "Fred and George have lost loads\nof points in all the time theyve been here and people still like\nthem.",
    "Theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have\nthey said Harry miserably.",
    "Well  no Ron admitted.",
    "It was a bit late to repair the damage but Harry swore to himself not\nto meddle in things that werent his business from now on.",
    "Hed had it\nwith sneaking around and spying.",
    "He felt so ashamed of himself that he\nwent to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.",
    "Resign Wood thundered.",
    "What goodll that do How are we going to get\nany points back if we cant win at Quidditch\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun.",
    "The rest of the team wouldnt speak\nto Harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they\ncalled him the Seeker.",
    "Hermione and Neville were suffering too.",
    "They didnt have as bad a time\nas Harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to\nthem either.",
    "Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\nclass keeping her head down and working in silence.",
    "Harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away.",
    "All the studying\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery.",
    "He Ron and Hermione kept to\nthemselves working late into the night trying to remember the\ningredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart\nmemorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\n\nThen about a week before the exams were due to start Harrys new\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put\nto an unexpected test.",
    "Walking back from the library on his own one\nafternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.",
    "As he\ndrew closer he heard Quirrells voice.",
    "No  no  not again please \n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him.",
    "Harry moved closer.",
    "All right  all right  he heard Quirrell sob.",
    "Next second Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\nhis turban.",
    "He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.",
    "He\nstrode out of sight Harry didnt think Quirrell had even noticed him.",
    "He waited until Quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into\nthe classroom.",
    "It was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end.",
    "Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised\nhimself about not meddling.",
    "All the same hed have gambled twelve Sorcerers Stones that Snape had\njust left the room and from what Harry had just heard Snape would be\nwalking with a new spring in his step  Quirrell seemed to have given\nin at last.",
    "Harry went back to the library where Hermione was testing Ron on\nAstronomy.",
    "Harry told them what hed heard.",
    "Snapes done it then said Ron.",
    "If Quirrells told him how to break\nhis AntiDark Force spell \n\nTheres still Fluffy though said Hermione.",
    "Maybe Snapes found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid\nsaid Ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.",
    "I bet\ntheres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\nthreeheaded dog.",
    "So what do we do Harry\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Rons eyes but Hermione\nanswered before Harry could.",
    "Go to Dumbledore.",
    "Thats what we should have done ages ago.",
    "If we try\nanything ourselves well be thrown out for sure.",
    "But weve got no proof said Harry.",
    "Quirrells too scared to back us\nup.",
    "Snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at\nHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor  who do you\nthink theyll believe him or us Its not exactly a secret we hate him\nDumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked.",
    "Filch wouldnt help\nus if his life depended on it hes too friendly with Snape and the\nmore students get thrown out the better hell think.",
    "And dont forget\nwere not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy.",
    "Thatll take a lot\nof explaining.",
    "Hermione looked convinced but Ron didnt.",
    "If we just do a bit of poking around \n\nNo said Harry flatly weve done enough poking around.",
    "He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\nits moons.",
    "The following morning notes were delivered to Harry Hermione and\nNeville at the breakfast table.",
    "They were all the same\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight.",
    "Meet Mr. Filch\nin the entrance hall.",
    "Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do\nin the furor over the points theyd lost.",
    "He half expected Hermione to\ncomplain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt\nsay a word.",
    "Like Harry she felt they deserved what theyd got.",
    "At eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to Ron in the common\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.",
    "Filch was already\nthere  and so was Malfoy.",
    "Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had\ngotten a detention too.",
    "Follow me said Filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside.",
    "I bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you\neh he said leering at them.",
    "Oh yes... hard work and pain are the\nbest teachers if you ask me.... Its just a pity they let the old\npunishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a\nfew days Ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in\ncase theyre ever needed....",
    "Right off we go and dont think of\nrunning off now itll be worse for you if you do.",
    "They marched off across the dark grounds.",
    "Neville kept sniffing.",
    "Harry\nwondered what their punishment was going to be.",
    "It must be something\nreally horrible or Filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted.",
    "The moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\ninto darkness.",
    "Ahead Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrids\nhut.",
    "Then they heard a distant shout.",
    "Is that you Filch Hurry up I want ter get started.",
    "Harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\nwouldnt be so bad.",
    "His relief must have showed in his face because\nFilch said I suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that\noaf Well think again boy  its into the forest youre going and Im\nmuch mistaken if youll all come out in one piece.",
    "At this Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in his\ntracks.",
    "The forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual.",
    "We cant go in there at night  theres all sorts of things in there\n werewolves I heard.",
    "Neville clutched the sleeve of Harrys robe and made a choking noise.",
    "Thats your problem isnt it said Filch his voice cracking with\nglee.",
    "Shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble\nshouldnt you\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark Fang at his heel.",
    "He\nwas carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his\nshoulder.",
    "Abou time he said.",
    "I bin waitin fer half an hour already.",
    "All\nright Harry Hermione\n\nI shouldnt be too friendly to them Hagrid said Filch coldly\ntheyre here to be punished after all.",
    "Thats why yer late is it said Hagrid frowning at Filch.",
    "Bin\nlecturin them eh Snot your place ter do that.",
    "Yehve done yer bit\nIll take over from here.",
    "Ill be back at dawn said Filch for whats left of them he added\nnastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp\nbobbing away in the darkness.",
    "Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.",
    "Im not going in that forest he said and Harry was pleased to hear\nthe note of panic in his voice.",
    "Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts said Hagrid fiercely.",
    "Yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it.",
    "But this is servant stuff its not for students to do.",
    "I thought wed\nbe copying lines or something if my father knew I was doing this hed\n\ntell yer thats how it is at Hogwarts Hagrid growled.",
    "Copyin lines\nWhat goods that ter anyone Yehll do summat useful or Yehll get out.",
    "If yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off\nter the castle an pack.",
    "Go on\n\nMalfoy didnt move.",
    "He looked at Hagrid furiously but then dropped his\ngaze.",
    "Right then said Hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous\nwhat were gonna do tonight an I don want no one takin risks.",
    "Follow\nme over here a moment.",
    "He led them to the very edge of the forest.",
    "Holding his lamp up high he\npointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the\nthick black trees.",
    "A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into\nthe forest.",
    "Look there said Hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground\nSilvery stuff Thats unicorn blood.",
    "Theres a unicorn in there bin hurt\nbadly by summat.",
    "This is the second time in a week.",
    "I found one dead\nlast Wednesday.",
    "Were gonna try an find the poor thing.",
    "We might have\nter put it out of its misery.",
    "And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said Malfoy\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.",
    "Theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with\nme or Fang said Hagrid.",
    "An keep ter the path.",
    "Right now were\ngonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent\ndirections.",
    "Theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin\naround since last night at least.",
    "I want Fang said Malfoy quickly looking at Fangs long teeth.",
    "All right but I warn yeh hes a coward said Hagrid.",
    "So me Harry\nan Hermionell go one way an Draco Neville an Fangll go the other.",
    "Now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right\nGet yer wands out an practice now  thats it  an if anyone gets in\ntrouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh  so be\ncareful  lets go.",
    "The forest was black and silent.",
    "A little way into it they reached a\nfork in the earth path and Harry Hermione and Hagrid took the left\npath while Malfoy Neville and Fang took the right.",
    "They walked in silence their eyes on the ground.",
    "Every now and then a\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue\nblood on the fallen leaves.",
    "Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.",
    "Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns Harry asked.",
    "Not fast enough said Hagrid.",
    "Its not easy ter catch a unicorn\ntheyre powerful magic creatures.",
    "I never knew one ter be hurt before.",
    "They walked past a mossy tree stump.",
    "Harry could hear running water\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by.",
    "There were still spots of\nunicorn blood here and there along the winding path.",
    "You all right Hermione Hagrid whispered.",
    "Don worry it cantve\ngone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter  GET\nBEHIND THAT TREE\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a\ntowering oak.",
    "He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow\nraising it ready to fire.",
    "The three of them listened.",
    "Something was\nslithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing\nalong the ground.",
    "Hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few\nseconds the sound faded away.",
    "I knew it  he murmured.",
    "Theres summat in here that shouldn be.",
    "A werewolf Harry suggested.",
    "That wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said Hagrid\ngrimly.",
    "Right follow me but careful now.",
    "They walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound.",
    "Suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved.",
    "Whos there Hagrid called.",
    "Show yerself  Im armed\n\nAnd into the clearing came  was it a man or a horse To the waist a\nman with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming\nchestnut body with a long reddish tail.",
    "Harry and Hermiones jaws\ndropped.",
    "Oh its you Ronan said Hagrid in relief.",
    "How are yeh\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaurs hand.",
    "Good evening to you Hagrid said Ronan.",
    "He had a deep sorrowful\nvoice.",
    "Were you going to shoot me\n\nCant be too careful Ronan said Hagrid patting his crossbow.",
    "Theres summat bad loose in this forest.",
    "This is Harry Potter an\nHermione Granger by the way.",
    "Students up at the school.",
    "An this is\nRonan you two.",
    "Hes a centaur.",
    "Wed noticed said Hermione faintly.",
    "Good evening said Ronan.",
    "Students are you And do you learn much\nup at the school\n\nErm \n\nA bit said Hermione timidly.",
    "A bit.",
    "Well thats something.",
    "Ronan sighed.",
    "He flung back his head\nand stared at the sky.",
    "Mars is bright tonight.",
    "Yeah said Hagrid glancing up too.",
    "Listen Im glad weve run inter\nyeh Ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt  you seen anythin\n\nRonan didnt answer immediately.",
    "He stared unblinkingly upward then\nsighed again.",
    "Always the innocent are the first victims he said.",
    "So it has been\nfor ages past so it is now.",
    "Yeah said Hagrid but have yeh seen anythin Ronan Anythin\nunusual\n\nMars is bright tonight Ronan repeated while Hagrid watched him\nimpatiently.",
    "Unusually bright.",
    "Yeah but I was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said\nHagrid.",
    "So yeh havent noticed anythin strange\n\nYet again Ronan took a while to answer.",
    "At last he said The forest\nhides many secrets.",
    "A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again\nbut it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and\nwilderlooking than Ronan.",
    "Hullo Bane said Hagrid.",
    "All right\n\nGood evening Hagrid I hope you are well\n\nWell enough.",
    "Look Ive jus bin askin Ronan you seen anythin odd in\nhere lately Theres a unicorn bin injured  would yeh know anythin\nabout it\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan.",
    "He looked skyward.",
    "Mars is\nbright tonight he said simply.",
    "Weve heard said Hagrid grumpily.",
    "Well if either of you do see\nanythin let me know wont yeh Well be off then.",
    "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.",
    "Never said Hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a\ncentaur.",
    "Ruddy stargazers.",
    "Not interested in anythin closern the\nmoon.",
    "Are there many of them in here asked Hermione.",
    "Oh a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre\ngood enough about turnin up if ever I want a word.",
    "Theyre deep mind\ncentaurs... they know things... jus don let on much.",
    "Dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said Harry.",
    "Did that sound like hooves to you Nah if yeh ask me that was whats\nbin killin the unicorns  never heard anythin like it before.",
    "They walked on through the dense dark trees.",
    "Harry kept looking\nnervously over his shoulder.",
    "He had the nasty feeling they were being\nwatched.",
    "He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.",
    "They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrids\narm.",
    "Hagrid Look Red sparks the others are in trouble\n\nYou two wait here Hagrid shouted.",
    "Stay on the path Ill come back\nfor yeh\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking\nat each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the\nrustling of leaves around them.",
    "You dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered Hermione.",
    "I dont care if Malfoy has but if somethings got Neville... its our\nfault hes here in the first place.",
    "The minutes dragged by.",
    "Their ears seemed sharper than usual.",
    "Harrys\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig.",
    "What was going on Where were the others\n\nAt last a great crunching noise announced Hagrids return.",
    "Malfoy\nNeville and Fang were with him.",
    "Hagrid was fuming.",
    "Malfoy it seemed\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.",
    "Neville had\npanicked and sent up the sparks.",
    "Well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were\nmakin.",
    "Right were changin groups  Neville you stay with me an\nHermione Harry you go with Fang an this idiot.",
    "Im sorry Hagrid\nadded in a whisper to Harry but hell have a harder time frightenin\nyou an weve gotta get this done.",
    "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.",
    "They\nwalked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until\nthe path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so\nthick.",
    "Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.",
    "There were\nsplashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been\nthrashing around in pain close by.",
    "Harry could see a clearing ahead\nthrough the tangled branches of an ancient oak.",
    "Look  he murmured holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.",
    "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground.",
    "They inched closer.",
    "It was the unicorn all right and it was dead.",
    "Harry had never seen\nanything so beautiful and sad.",
    "Its long slender legs were stuck out at\nodd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on\nthe dark leaves.",
    "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\nfreeze where he stood.",
    "A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....\nThen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the\nground like some stalking beast.",
    "Harry Malfoy and Fang stood\ntransfixed.",
    "The cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head\nover the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood.",
    "AAAAAAAAAARGH\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted  so did Fang.",
    "The hooded\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry  unicorn blood was\ndribbling down its front.",
    "It got to its feet and came swiftly toward\nHarry  he couldnt move for fear.",
    "Then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as\nthough his scar were on fire.",
    "Half blinded he staggered backward.",
    "He\nheard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over\nHarry charging at the figure.",
    "The pain in Harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees.",
    "It took a\nminute or two to pass.",
    "When he looked up the figure had gone.",
    "A centaur\nwas standing over him not Ronan or Bane this one looked younger he\nhad whiteblond hair and a palomino body.",
    "Are you all right said the centaur pulling Harry to his feet.",
    "Yes  thank you  what was that\n\nThe centaur didnt answer.",
    "He had astonishingly blue eyes like pale\nsapphires.",
    "He looked carefully at Harry his eyes lingering on the scar\nthat stood out livid on Harrys forehead.",
    "You are the Potter boy he said.",
    "You had better get back to Hagrid.",
    "The forest is not safe at this time  especially for you.",
    "Can you ride\nIt will be quicker this way.",
    "My name is Firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.",
    "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\nclearing.",
    "Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees their flanks\nheaving and sweaty.",
    "Firenze Bane thundered.",
    "What are you doing You have a human on your\nback Have you no shame Are you a common mule\n\nDo you realize who this is said Firenze.",
    "This is the Potter boy.",
    "The\nquicker he leaves this forest the better.",
    "What have you been telling him growled Bane.",
    "Remember Firenze we\nare sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens.",
    "Have we not read\nwhat is to come in the movements of the planets\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously.",
    "Im sure Firenze thought he was\nacting for the best  he said in his gloomy voice.",
    "Bane kicked his back legs in anger.",
    "For the best What is that to do with us Centaurs are concerned with\nwhat has been foretold It is not our business to run around like\ndonkeys after stray humans in our forest\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that Harry had\nto grab his shoulders to stay on.",
    "Do you not see that unicorn Firenze bellowed at Bane.",
    "Do you not\nunderstand why it was killed Or have the planets not let you in on that\nsecret I set myself against what is lurking in this forest Bane yes\nwith humans alongside me if I must.",
    "And Firenze whisked around with Harry clutching on as best he could\nthey plunged off into the trees leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.",
    "Harry didnt have a clue what was going on.",
    "Whys Bane so angry he asked.",
    "What was that thing you saved me from\nanyway\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of\nlowhanging branches but did not answer Harrys question.",
    "They made\ntheir way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought\nFirenze didnt want to talk to him anymore.",
    "They were passing through a\nparticularly dense patch of trees however when Firenze suddenly\nstopped.",
    "Harry Potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for\n\nNo said Harry startled by the odd question.",
    "Weve only used the\nhorn and tail hair in Potions.",
    "That is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said\nFirenze.",
    "Only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain\nwould commit such a crime.",
    "The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive\neven if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price.",
    "You have\nslain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have\nbut a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your\nlips.",
    "Harry stared at the back of Firenzes head which was dappled silver in\nthe moonlight.",
    "But whod be that desperate he wondered aloud.",
    "If youre going to be\ncursed forever deaths better isnt it\n\nIt is Firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long\nenough to drink something else  something that will bring you back to\nfull strength and power  something that will mean you can never die.",
    "Mr. Potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very\nmoment\n\nThe Sorcerers Stone Of course  the Elixir of Life But I dont\nunderstand who \n\nCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power\nwho has clung to life awaiting their chance\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harrys\nheart.",
    "Over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what\nHagrid had told him on the night they had met Some say he died.",
    "Codswallop in my opinion.",
    "Dunno if he had enough human left in him to\ndie.",
    "Do you mean Harry croaked that was Vol\n\nHarry Harry are you all right\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path Hagrid puffing along\nbehind her.",
    "Im fine said Harry hardly knowing what he was saying.",
    "The\nunicorns dead Hagrid its in that clearing back there.",
    "This is where I leave you Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\nexamine the unicorn.",
    "You are safe now.",
    "Harry slid off his back.",
    "Good luck Harry Potter said Firenze.",
    "The planets have been read\nwrongly before now even by centaurs.",
    "I hope this is one of those\ntimes.",
    "He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving Harry\nshivering behind him.",
    "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to\nreturn.",
    "He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly\nshook him awake.",
    "In a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as\nHarry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.",
    "Harry couldnt sit down.",
    "He paced up and down in front of the fire.",
    "He\nwas still shaking.",
    "Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemorts waiting in the\nforest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\nrich....\n\nStop saying the name said Ron in a terrified whisper as if he\nthought Voldemort could hear them.",
    "Harry wasnt listening.",
    "Firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so.... Bane was furious...\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\nhappen....",
    "They must show that Voldemorts coming back.... Bane thinks\nFirenze should have let Voldemort kill me....",
    "I suppose thats written\nin the stars as well.",
    "Will you stop saying the name Ron hissed.",
    "So all Ive got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone Harry\nwent on feverishly then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me\noff... Well I suppose Banell be happy.",
    "Hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort.",
    "Harry everyone says Dumbledores the only one YouKnowWho was ever\nafraid of With Dumbledore around YouKnowWho wont touch you.",
    "Anyway\nwho says the centaurs are right It sounds like fortunetelling to me\nand Professor McGonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic.",
    "The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.",
    "They went to bed\nexhausted their throats sore.",
    "But the nights surprises werent over.",
    "When Harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak\nfolded neatly underneath them.",
    "There was a note pinned to it\n\nJust in case.",
    "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\nIn years to come Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\nget through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\nthrough the door at any moment.",
    "Yet the days crept by and there could\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.",
    "It was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did\ntheir written papers.",
    "They had been given special new quills for the\nexams which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.",
    "They had practical exams as well.",
    "Professor Flitwick called them one by\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\na desk.",
    "Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\n points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if\nit had whiskers.",
    "Snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks\nwhile they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.",
    "Harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\nforehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the\nforest.",
    "Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because\nHarry couldnt sleep but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\nhis old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there\nwas a hooded figure dripping blood in it.",
    "Maybe it was because they hadnt seen what Harry had seen in the forest\nor because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but Ron\nand Hermione didnt seem as worried about the Stone as Harry.",
    "The idea\nof Voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in\ndreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much\ntime to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.",
    "Their very last exam was History of Magic.",
    "One hour of answering\nquestions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons\nand theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\nresults came out.",
    "When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment Harry couldnt help\ncheering with the rest.",
    "That was far easier than I thought it would be said Hermione as they\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.",
    "I neednt have\nlearned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\nElfric the Eager.",
    "Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but Ron\nsaid this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree.",
    "The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the\ntentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows.",
    "No\nmore studying Ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass.",
    "You\ncould look more cheerful Harry weve got a week before we find out how\nbadly weve done theres no need to worry yet.",
    "Harry was rubbing his forehead.",
    "I wish I knew what this means he burst out angrily.",
    "My scar keeps\nhurting  its happened before but never as often as this.",
    "Go to Madam Pomfrey Hermione suggested.",
    "Im not ill said Harry.",
    "I think its a warning... it means dangers\ncoming....\n\nRon couldnt get worked up it was too hot.",
    "Harry relax Hermiones right the Stones safe as long as\nDumbledores around.",
    "Anyway weve never had any proof Snape found out\nhow to get past Fluffy.",
    "He nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry.",
    "And Neville will play Quidditch for\nEngland before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.",
    "Harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was\nsomething hed forgotten to do something important.",
    "When he tried to\nexplain this Hermione said Thats just the exams.",
    "I woke up last\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I\nremembered wed done that one.",
    "Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do\nwith work though.",
    "He watched an owl flutter toward the school across\nthe bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth.",
    "Hagrid was the only\none who ever sent him letters.",
    "Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.",
    "Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but \n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.",
    "Wherere you going said Ron sleepily.",
    "Ive just thought of something said Harry.",
    "He had turned white.",
    "Weve got to go and see Hagrid now.",
    "Why panted Hermione hurrying to keep up.",
    "Dont you think its a bit odd said Harry scrambling up the grassy\nslope that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and\na stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket How\nmany people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law\nLucky they found Hagrid dont you think Why didnt I see it before\n\nWhat are you talking about said Ron but Harry sprinting across the\ngrounds toward the forest didnt answer.",
    "Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and\nsleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.",
    "Hullo he said smiling.",
    "Finished yer exams Got time fer a drink\n\nYes please said Ron but Harry cut him off.",
    "No were in a hurry.",
    "Hagrid Ive got to ask you something.",
    "You know\nthat night you won Norbert What did the stranger you were playing cards\nwith look like\n\nDunno said Hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off.",
    "He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.",
    "Its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the Hogs Head \nthats the pub down in the village.",
    "Mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn\nhe I never saw his face he kept his hood up.",
    "Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.",
    "What did you talk to him\nabout Hagrid Did you mention Hogwarts at all\n\nMighta come up said Hagrid frowning as he tried to remember.",
    "Yeah... he asked what I did an I told him I was gamekeeper here....",
    "He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\nhim... an I said what Id always really wanted was a dragon... an\nthen...",
    "I can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks....",
    "Lets see... yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play\ncards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it he\ndidn want it ter go ter any old home....",
    "So I told him after Fluffy a\ndragon would be easy...\n\nAnd did he  did he seem interested in Fluffy Harry asked try ing\nto keep his voice calm.",
    "Well  yeah  how many threeheaded dogs dyeh meet even around\nHogwarts So I told him Fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to\ncalm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off\nter sleep \n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.",
    "I shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out.",
    "Forget I said it Hey \nwherere yeh goin\n\nHarry Ron and Hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy\nafter the grounds.",
    "Weve got to go to Dumbledore said Harry.",
    "Hagrid told that stranger\nhow to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\ncloak  it mustve been easy once hed got Hagrid drunk.",
    "I just hope\nDumbledore believes us.",
    "Firenze might back us up if Bane doesnt stop\nhim.",
    "Wheres Dumbledores office\n\nThey looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the\nright direction.",
    "They had never been told where Dumbledore lived nor\ndid they know anyone who had been sent to see him.",
    "Well just have to  Harry began but a voice suddenly rang across\nthe hall.",
    "What are you three doing inside\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall carrying a large pile of books.",
    "We want to see Professor Dumbledore said Hermione rather bravely\nHarry and Ron thought.",
    "See Professor Dumbledore Professor McGonagall repeated as though\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do.",
    "Why\n\nHarry swallowed  now what\n\nIts sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because\nProfessor McGonagalls nostrils flared.",
    "Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly.",
    "He\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for\nLondon at once.",
    "Hes gone said Harry frantically.",
    "Now\n\nProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard Potter he has many\ndemands on his time \n\nBut this is important.",
    "Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic\nPotter.",
    "Look said Harry throwing caution to the winds Professor  its\nabout the Sorcerers tone \n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected it wasnt that.",
    "The books\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up.",
    "How do you know  she spluttered.",
    "Professor I think  I know  that Sn that someones going to try\nand steal the Stone.",
    "Ive got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.",
    "She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.",
    "Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally.",
    "I dont\nknow how you found out about the Stone but rest assured no one can\npossibly steal it its too well protected.",
    "But Professor \n\nPotter I know what Im talking about she said shortly.",
    "She bent down\nand gathered up the fallen books.",
    "I suggest you all go back outside and\nenjoy the sunshine.",
    "But they didnt.",
    "Its tonight said Harry once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\nout of earshot.",
    "Snapes going through the trapdoor tonight.",
    "Hes found\nout everything he needs and now hes got Dumbledore out of the way.",
    "He\nsent that note I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when\nDumbledore turns up.",
    "But what can we \n\nHermione gasped.",
    "Harry and Ron wheeled round.",
    "Snape was standing there.",
    "Good afternoon he said smoothly.",
    "They stared at him.",
    "You shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd\ntwisted smile.",
    "We were  Harry began without any idea what he was going to say.",
    "You want to be more careful said Snape.",
    "Hanging around\n\nlike this people will think youre up to something.",
    "And Gryffindor\nreally cant afford to lose any more points can it\n\nHarry flushed.",
    "They turned to go outside but Snape called them back.",
    "Be warned Potter  any more nighttime wanderings and I will\npersonally make sure you are expelled.",
    "Good day to you.",
    "He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.",
    "Out on the stone steps Harry turned to the others.",
    "Right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently.",
    "One of us\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape  wait outside the staff room and\nfollow him if he leaves it.",
    "Hermione youd better do that.",
    "Why me\n\nIts obvious said Ron.",
    "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\nFlitwick you know.",
    "He put on a high voice Oh Professor Flitwick\nIm so worried I think I got question fourteen b wrong....\n\nOh shut up said Hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for\nSnape.",
    "And wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor Harry told Ron.",
    "Come on.",
    "But that part of the plan didnt work.",
    "No sooner had they reached the\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor\nMcGonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper.",
    "I suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of\nenchantments she stormed.",
    "Enough of this nonsense If I hear you ve\ncome anywhere near here again Ill take another fifty points from\nGryffindor Yes Weasley from my own house Harry and Ron went back to\nthe common room Harry had just said At least Hermiones on Snapes\ntail when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\nin.",
    "Im sorry Harry she wailed.",
    "Snape came out and asked me what I was\ndoing so I said I was waiting for Flitwick and Snape went to get him\nand Ive only just got away I dont know where Snape went.",
    "Well thats it then isnt it Harry said.",
    "The other two stared at him.",
    "He was pale and his eyes were glittering.",
    "Im going out of here tonight and Im going to try and get to the Stone\nfirst.",
    "Youre mad said Ron.",
    "You cant said Hermione.",
    "After what McGonagall and Snape have said\nYoull be expelled\n\nSO WHAP Harry shouted.",
    "Dont you understand If Snape gets hold of\nthe Stone Voldemorts coming back Havent you heard what it was like\nwhen he was trying to take over There wont be any Hogwarts to get\nexpelled from Hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the Dark\nArts Losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see Dyou think\nhell leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house\ncup If I get caught before I can get to the Stone well Ill have to\ngo back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there its\nonly dying a bit later than I would have because Im never going over\nto the Dark Side Im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\nyou two say is going to stop me Voldemort killed my parents remember\n\nHe glared at them.",
    "Youre right Harry said Hermione in a small voice.",
    "Ill use the invisibility cloak said Harry.",
    "Its just lucky I got it\nback.",
    "But will it cover all three of us said Ron.",
    "All  all three of us\n\nOh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone\n\nOf course not said Hermione briskly.",
    "How do you think youd get to\nthe Stone without us Id better go and took through my books there\nmight be something useful...",
    "But if we get caught you two will be expelled too.",
    "Not if I can help it said Hermione grimly.",
    "Flitwick told me in\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.",
    "Theyre not\nthrowing me out after that.",
    "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.",
    "Nobody bothered them none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to\nHarry any more after all.",
    "This was the first night he hadnt been upset\nby it.",
    "Hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come\nacross one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.",
    "Harry\nand Ron didnt talk much.",
    "Both of them were thinking about what they\nwere about to do.",
    "Slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.",
    "Better get the cloak Ron muttered as Lee Jordan finally left\nstretching and yawning.",
    "Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.",
    "He\nputted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\ngiven him for Christmas.",
    "He pocketed it to use on Fluffy  he didnt\nfeel much like singing.",
    "He ran back down to the common room.",
    "Wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of\nus  if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own \n\nWhat are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room.",
    "Neville\nappeared from behind an armchair clutching Trevor the toad who looked\nas though hed been making another bid for freedom.",
    "Nothing Neville nothing said Harry hurriedly putting the cloak\nbehind his back.",
    "Neville stared at their guilty faces.",
    "Youre going out again he said.",
    "No no no said Hermione.",
    "No were not.",
    "Why dont you go to bed\nNeville\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.",
    "They couldnt afford\nto waste any more time Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.",
    "You cant go out said Neville youll be caught again.",
    "Gryffindor\nwill be in even more trouble.",
    "You dont understand said Harry this is important.",
    "But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.",
    "I wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the\nportrait hole.",
    "Ill  Ill fight you\n\nNeville Ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot\n\n\nDont you call me an idiot said Neville.",
    "I dont think you should be\nbreaking any more rules And you were the one who told me to stand up to\npeople\n\nYes but not to us said Ron in exasperation.",
    "Neville you dont know\nwhat youre doing.",
    "He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad who leapt\nout of sight.",
    "Go on then try and hit me said Neville raising his fists.",
    "Im\nready\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.",
    "Do something he said desperately.",
    "Hermione stepped forward.",
    "Neville she said Im really really sorry about this.",
    "She raised her wand.",
    "Petrificus Totalus she cried pointing it at Neville.",
    "Nevilles arms snapped to his sides.",
    "His legs sprang together.",
    "His whole\nbody rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face\nstiff as a board.",
    "Hermione ran to turn him over.",
    "Nevilles jaws were jammed together so he\ncouldnt speak.",
    "Only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror.",
    "Whatve you done to him Harry whispered.",
    "Its the full BodyBind said Hermione miserably.",
    "Oh Neville Im so\nsorry.",
    "We had to Neville no time to explain said Harry.",
    "Youll understand later Neville said Ron as they stepped over him\nand pulled on the invisibility cloak.",
    "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a\nvery good omen.",
    "In their nervous state every statues shadow looked\nlike Filch every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping\ndown on them.",
    "At the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted Mrs.\nNorris skulking near the top.",
    "Oh lets kick her just this once Ron whispered in Harrys ear but\nHarry shook his head.",
    "As they climbed carefully around her Mrs. Norris\nturned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything.",
    "They didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\nthird floor.",
    "Peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that\npeople would trip.",
    "Whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him.",
    "He narrowed\nhis wicked black eyes.",
    "Know youre there even if I cant see you.",
    "Are\nyou ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them.",
    "Should call Filch I should if somethings acreeping around unseen.",
    "Harry had a sudden idea.",
    "Peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the Bloody Baron has his own\nreasons for being invisible.",
    "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock.",
    "He caught himself in time\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs.",
    "So sorry your bloodiness Mr. Baron Sir he said greasily.",
    "My\nmistake my mistake  I didnt see you  of course I didnt youre\ninvisible  forgive old Peevsie his little joke sir.",
    "I have business here Peeves croaked Harry.",
    "Stay away from this\nplace tonight.",
    "I will sir I most certainly will said Peeves rising up in the air\nagain.",
    "Hope your business goes well Baron Ill not bother you.",
    "And he scooted off\n\nBrilliant Harry whispered Ron.",
    "A few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor\n and the door was already ajar.",
    "Well there you are Harry said quietly Snapes already got past\nFluffy.",
    "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\nwhat was facing them.",
    "Underneath the cloak Harry turned to the other\ntwo.",
    "If you want to go back I wont blame you he said.",
    "You can take the\ncloak I wont need it now.",
    "Dont be stupid said Ron.",
    "Were coming said Hermione.",
    "Harry pushed the door open.",
    "As the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears.",
    "All three of\nthe dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it\ncouldnt see them.",
    "Whats that at its feet Hermione whispered.",
    "Looks like a harp said Ron.",
    "Snape must have left it there.",
    "It must wake up the moment you stop playing said Harry.",
    "Well here\ngoes...",
    "He put Hagrids flute to his lips and blew.",
    "It wasnt really a tune but\nfrom the first note the beasts eyes began to droop.",
    "Harry hardly drew\nbreath.",
    "Slowly the dogs growls ceased  it tottered on its paws and\nfell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep.",
    "Keep playing Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\ncrept toward the trapdoor.",
    "They could feel the dogs hot smelly breath\nas they approached the giant heads.",
    "I think well be able to pull the\ndoor open said Ron peering over the dogs back.",
    "Want to go first\nHermione\n\nNo I dont\n\nAll right.",
    "Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs\nlegs.",
    "He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and\nopen.",
    "What can you see Hermione said anxiously.",
    "Nothing  just black  theres no way of climbing down well just\nhave to drop.",
    "Harry who was still playing the flute waved at Ron to get his\nattention and pointed at himself.",
    "You want to go first Are you sure said Ron.",
    "I dont know how deep\nthis thing goes.",
    "Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.",
    "Harry handed the flute over.",
    "In the few seconds silence the dog\ngrowled and twitched but the moment Hermione began to play it fell\nback into its deep sleep.",
    "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor.",
    "There was no\nsign of the bottom.",
    "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\nfingertips.",
    "Then he looked up at Ron and said If anything happens to\nme dont follow.",
    "Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore right\n\nRight said Ron.",
    "See you in a minute I hope...\n\nAnd Harry let go.",
    "Cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down\ndown and  FLUMP.",
    "With a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on\nsomething soft.",
    "He sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the\ngloom.",
    "It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.",
    "Its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp\nwhich was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump\n\nRon followed right away.",
    "He landed sprawled next to Harry.",
    "Whats this stuff were his first words.",
    "Dunno some sort of plant thing.",
    "I suppose its here to break the fall.",
    "Come on Hermione\n\nThe distant music stopped.",
    "There was a loud bark from the dog but\nHermione had already jumped.",
    "She landed on Harrys other side.",
    "We must be miles under the school  she said.",
    "Lucky this plant things here really said Ron.",
    "Lucky shrieked Hermione.",
    "Look at you both\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall.",
    "She had to struggle\nbecause the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles.",
    "As for Harry and Ron their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.",
    "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\nher.",
    "Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\noff them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster\nthe plant wound around them.",
    "Stop moving Hermione ordered them.",
    "I know what this is  its\nDevils Snare\n\nOh Im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled\nRon leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his\nneck.",
    "Shut up Im trying to remember how to kill it said Hermione.",
    "Well hurry up I cant breathe Harry gasped wrestling with it as it\ncurled around his chest.",
    "Devils Snare Devils Snare... what did Professor Sprout say  it\nlikes the dark and the damp\n\nSo light a fire Harry choked.",
    "Yes  of course  but theres no wood Hermione cried wringing her\nhands.",
    "HAVE YOU GONE MAD Ron bellowed.",
    "ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT\n\nOh right said Hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it\nmuttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\nused on Snape at the plant.",
    "In a matter of seconds the two boys felt it\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.",
    "Wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they\nwere able to pull free.",
    "Lucky you pay attention in Herbology Hermione said Harry as he\njoined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face.",
    "Yeah said Ron and lucky Harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis \ntheres no wood honestly.",
    "This way said Harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the\nonly way forward.",
    "All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\nwater trickling down the walls.",
    "The passageway sloped downward and\nHarry was reminded of Gringotts.",
    "With an unpleasant jolt of the heart\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\nbank.",
    "If they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon  Norbert had been bad\nenough...\n\nCan you hear something Ron whispered.",
    "Harry listened.",
    "A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\nahead.",
    "Do you think its a ghost\n\nI dont know... sounds like wings to me.",
    "Theres light ahead  I can see something moving.",
    "They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\nlit chamber its ceiling arching high above them.",
    "It was full of small\njewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room.",
    "On the\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.",
    "Do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said Ron.",
    "Probably said Harry.",
    "They dont look very vicious but I suppose if\nthey all swooped down at once... well theres no other choice... Ill\nrun.",
    "He took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted\nacross the room.",
    "He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second but nothing happened.",
    "He reached the door untouched.",
    "He\npulled the handle but it was locked.",
    "The other two followed him.",
    "They tugged and heaved at the door but it\nwouldnt budge not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.",
    "Now what said Ron.",
    "These birds... they cant be here just for decoration said Hermione.",
    "They watched the birds soaring overhead glittering  glittering\n\nTheyre not birds Harry said suddenly.",
    "Theyre keys Winged keys \nlook carefully.",
    "So that must mean... he looked around the chamber while\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys.",
    "... yes  look\nBroomsticks Weve got to catch the key to the door\n\nBut there are hundreds of them\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.",
    "Were looking for a big oldfashioned one  probably silver like the\nhandle.",
    "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into\nthe midst of the cloud of keys.",
    "They grabbed and snatched but the\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\ncatch one.",
    "Not for nothing though was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.",
    "He\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didnt.",
    "After a minutes\nweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large\nsilver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole.",
    "That one he called to the others.",
    "That big one  there  no there\n with bright blue wings  the feathers are all crumpled on one side.",
    "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing crashed into\nthe ceiling and nearly fell off his broom.",
    "Weve got to close in on it Harry called not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing.",
    "Ron you come at it from above  Hermione\nstay below and stop it from going down and Ill try and catch it.",
    "Right\nNOW\n\nRon dived Hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and Harry\nstreaked after it it sped toward the wall Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one\nhand.",
    "Ron and Hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber.",
    "They landed quickly and Harry ran to the door the key struggling in\nhis hand.",
    "He rammed it into the lock and turned  it worked.",
    "The moment\nthe lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.",
    "Ready Harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle.",
    "They\nnodded.",
    "He pulled the door open.",
    "The next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all.",
    "But as\nthey stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\nastonishing sight.",
    "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black\nchessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what\nlooked like black stone.",
    "Facing them way across the chamber were the\nwhite pieces.",
    "Harry Ron and Hermione shivered slightly  the towering\nwhite chessmen had no faces.",
    "Now what do we do Harry whispered.",
    "Its obvious isnt it said Ron.",
    "Weve got to play our way across\nthe room.",
    "Behind the white pieces they could see another door.",
    "How said Hermione nervously.",
    "I think said Ron were going to have to be chessmen.",
    "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\nknights horse.",
    "At once the stone sprang to life.",
    "The horse pawed the\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.",
    "Do we  er  have to join you to get across The black knight\nnodded.",
    "Ron turned to the other two.",
    "This needs thinking about \the said.",
    "I suppose weve got to take the\nplace of three of the black pieces....\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet watching Ron think.",
    "Finally he said\nNow dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at\nchess \n\nWere not offended said Harry quickly.",
    "Just tell us what to do.",
    "Well Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione YOU 90\nnext to him instead of that castle.",
    "What about you\n\nIm going to be a knight said Ron.",
    "The chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a\nknight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\nand walked off the board leaving three empty squares that Harry Ron\nand Hermione took.",
    "White always plays first in chess said Ron peering across the board.",
    "Yes... look...\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.",
    "Ron started to direct the black pieces.",
    "They moved silently wherever he\nsent them.",
    "Harrys knees were trembling.",
    "What if they lost\n\nHarry  move diagonally four squares to the right.",
    "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken.",
    "The white\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he\nlay quite still facedown.",
    "Had to let that happen said Ron looking shaken.",
    "Leaves you free to\ntake that bishop Hermione go on.",
    "Every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy.",
    "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.",
    "Twice Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\ndanger.",
    "He himself darted around the board taking almost as many white\npieces as they had lost black ones.",
    "Were nearly there he muttered suddenly.",
    "Let me think let me\nthink...",
    "The white queen turned her blank face toward him.",
    "Yes... said Ron softly Its the only way... Ive got to be taken.",
    "NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.",
    "Thats chess snapped Ron.",
    "Youve got to make some sacrifices I take\none step forward and shell take me  that leaves you free to checkmate\nthe king Harry\n\nBut \n\nDo you want to stop Snape or not\n\nRon \n\nLook if you dont hurry up hell already have the Stone\n\nThere was no alternative.",
    "Ready Ron called his face pale but determined.",
    "Here I go  now\ndont hang around once youve won.",
    "He stepped forward and the white queen pounced.",
    "She struck Ron hard\nacross the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor \nHermione screamed but stayed on her square  the white queen dragged Ron\nto one side.",
    "He looked as if hed been knocked out.",
    "Shaking Harry moved three spaces to the left.",
    "The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harrys feet.",
    "They had\nwon.",
    "The chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear.",
    "With\none last desperate look back at Ron Harry and Hermione charged through\nthe door and up the next passageway.",
    "What if hes \n\nHell be all right said Harry trying to convince himself.",
    "What do\nyou reckons next\n\nWeve had Sprouts that was the Devils Snare Flitwick mustve put\ncharms on the keys McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them\nalive that leaves Quirrells spell and Snapes.",
    "They had reached another door.",
    "All right Harry whispered.",
    "Go on.",
    "Harry pushed it open.",
    "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their\nrobes up over their noses.",
    "Eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in\nfront of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out\ncold with a bloody lump on its head.",
    "Im glad we didnt have to fight that one Harry whispered as they\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs.",
    "Come on I cant\nbreathe.",
    "He pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what\ncame next  but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table\nwith seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.",
    "Snapes said Harry.",
    "What do we have to do\n\nThey stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind\nthem in the doorway.",
    "It wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple.",
    "At\nthe same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.",
    "They were trapped.",
    "Look Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.",
    "Harry\nlooked over her shoulder to read it\n\nDanger lies before you while safety lies behind\n\nTwo of us will help you which ever you would find\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine\n\nThree of us are killers waiting bidden in line.",
    "Choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore\n\nTo help you in your choice we give you these clues four\n\nFirst however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wines left side\n\nSecond different are those who stand at either end\n\nBut if you would move onward neither is your friend\n\nThird as you see clearly all are different size\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides\n\nFourth the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them though different at first sight.",
    "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry amazed saw that she was\nsmiling the very last thing he felt like doing.",
    "Brilliant said Hermione.",
    "This isnt magic  its logic  a puzzle.",
    "A lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be\nstuck in here forever.",
    "But so will we wont we Of course not said Hermione.",
    "Everything\nwe need is here on this paper.",
    "Seven bottles three are poison two are\nwine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us\nback through the purple.",
    "But how do we know which to drink\n\nGive me a minute.",
    "Hermione read the paper several times.",
    "Then she walked up and down the\nline of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them.",
    "At last she\nclapped her hands.",
    "Got it she said.",
    "The smallest bottle will get us through the black\nfire  toward the Stone.",
    "Harry looked at the tiny bottle.",
    "Theres only enough there for one of us he said.",
    "Thats hardly one\nswallow.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Which one will get you back through the purple flames\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.",
    "You drink that said Harry.",
    "No listen get back and get Ron.",
    "Grab\nbrooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor\nand past Fluffy  go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore we need him.",
    "I might be able to hold Snape off for a while\nbut Im no match for him really.",
    "But Harry  what if YouKnowWhos with him\n\nWell  I was lucky once wasnt I said Harry pointing at his scar.",
    "I might get lucky again.",
    "Hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\narms around him.",
    "Hermione\n\nHarry  youre a great wizard you know.",
    "Im not as good as you said Harry very embarrassed as she let go of\nhim.",
    "Me said Hermione.",
    "Books And cleverness There are more important\nthings  friendship and bravery and  oh Harry  be careful\n\nYou drink first said Harry.",
    "You are sure which is which arent\nyou\n\nPositive said Hermione.",
    "She took a long drink from the round bottle\nat the end and shuddered.",
    "Its not poison said Harry anxiously.",
    "No  but its like ice.",
    "Quick go before it wears off.",
    "Good luck  take care.",
    "GO\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.",
    "Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle.",
    "He turned to\nface the black flames.",
    "Here I come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.",
    "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body.",
    "He put the bottle\ndown and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking\nhis body but couldnt feel them  for a moment he could see nothing\nbut dark fire  then he was on the other side in the last chamber.",
    "There was already someone there  but it wasnt Snape.",
    "It wasnt even\nVoldemort.",
    "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\nIt was Quirrell.",
    "You gasped Harry.",
    "Quirrell smiled.",
    "His face wasnt twitching at all.",
    "Me he said calmly.",
    "I wondered whether Id be meeting you here\nPotter.",
    "But I thought  Snape \n\nSeverus Quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble\neither but cold and sharp.",
    "Yes Severus does seem the type doesnt\nhe So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.",
    "Next to\nhim who would suspect pppoor ststuttering PProfessor Quirrell\n\nHarry couldnt take it in.",
    "This couldnt be true it couldnt.",
    "But Snape tried to kill me\n\nNo no no.",
    "I tried to kill you.",
    "Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch\nmatch.",
    "She broke my eye contact with you.",
    "Another few seconds and Id\nhave got you off that broom.",
    "Id have managed it before then if Snape\nhadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you.",
    "Snape was trying to save me\n\nOf course said Quirrell coolly.",
    "Why do you think he wanted to\nreferee your next match He was trying to make sure I didnt do it\nagain.",
    "Funny really... he neednt have bothered.",
    "I couldnt do anything\nwith Dumbledore watching.",
    "All the other teachers thought Snape was\ntrying to stop Gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular...\nand what a waste of time when after all that Im going to kill you\ntonight.",
    "Quirrell snapped his fingers.",
    "Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\nthemselves tightly around Harry.",
    "Youre too nosy to live Potter.",
    "Scurrying around the school on\nHalloween like that for all I knew youd seen me coming to look at what\nwas guarding the Stone.",
    "You let the troll in\n\nCertainly.",
    "I have a special gift with trolls  you must have seen what\nI did to the one in the chamber back there Unfortunately while\neveryone else was running around looking for it Snape who already\nsuspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off  and not\nonly did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog\ndidnt even manage to bite Snapes leg off properly.",
    "Now wait quietly Potter.",
    "I need to examine this interesting mirror.",
    "It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.",
    "It was the Mirror of Erised.",
    "This mirror is the key to finding the Stone Quirrell murmured\ntapping his way around the frame.",
    "Trust Dumbledore to come up with\nsomething like this... but hes in London... Ill be far away by the\ntime he gets back....\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.",
    "I saw you and Snape in the forest  he blurted out.",
    "Yes said Quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the\nback.",
    "He was on to me by that time trying to find out how far Id got.",
    "He suspected me all along.",
    "Tried to frighten me  as though he could\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into\nit.",
    "I see the Stone... Im presenting it to my master... but where is it\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give.",
    "He\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.",
    "But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.",
    "Oh he does said Quirrell casually heavens yes.",
    "He was at Hogwarts\nwith your father didnt you know They loathed each other.",
    "But he never\nwanted you dead.",
    "But I heard you a few days ago sobbing  I thought Snape was\nthreatening you....\n\nFor the first time a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrells face.",
    "Sometimes he said I find it hard to follow my masters instructions\n he is a great wizard and I am weak \n\nYou mean he was there in the classroom with you Harry gasped.",
    "He is with me wherever I go said Quirrell quietly.",
    "I met him when I\ntraveled around the world.",
    "A foolish young man I was then full of\nridiculous ideas about good and evil.",
    "Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong\nI was.",
    "There is no good and evil there is only power and those too\nweak to seek it....",
    "Since then I have served him faithfully although I\nhave let him down many times.",
    "He has had to be very hard on me.",
    "Quirrell shivered suddenly.",
    "He does not forgive mistakes easily.",
    "When I\nfailed to steal the stone from Gringotts he was most displeased.",
    "He\npunished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\n\nQuirrells voice trailed away.",
    "Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\nAlley how could he have been so stupid Hed seen Quirrell there that\nvery day shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.",
    "Quirrell cursed under his breath.",
    "I dont understand... is the Stone inside the mirror Should I break\nit\n\nHarrys mind was racing.",
    "What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment he\nthought is to find the Stone before Quirrell does.",
    "So if I look in the\nmirror I should see myseff finding it  which means Ill see where\nits hidden But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what Im up\nto\n\nHe tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without\nQuirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he\ntripped and fell over.",
    "Quirrell ignored him.",
    "He was still talking to\nhimself.",
    "What does this mirror do How does it work Help me Master\n\nAnd to Harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come\nfrom Quirrell himself\n\nUse the boy... Use the boy...\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.",
    "Yes  Potter  come here.",
    "He clapped his hands once and the ropes binding Harry fell off.",
    "Harry\ngot slowly to his feet.",
    "Come here Quirrell repeated.",
    "Look in the mirror and tell me what you\nsee.",
    "Harry walked toward him.",
    "I must lie he thought desperately.",
    "I must look and lie about what I\nsee thats all.",
    "Quirrell moved close behind him.",
    "Harry breathed in the funny smell that\nseemed to come from Quirrells turban.",
    "He closed his eyes stepped in\nfront of the mirror and opened them again.",
    "He saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first.",
    "But a moment\nlater the reflection smiled at him.",
    "It put its hand into its pocket and\npulled out a bloodred stone.",
    "It winked and put the Stone back in its\npocket  and as it did so Harry felt something heavy drop into his\nreal pocket.",
    "Somehow  incredibly  hed gotten the Stone.",
    "Well said Quirrell impatiently.",
    "What do you see\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.",
    "I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore he invented.",
    "I  Ive\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.",
    "Quirrell cursed again.",
    "Get out of the way he said.",
    "As Harry moved aside he felt the\nSorcerers Stone against his leg.",
    "Dare he make a break for it\n\nBut he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though\nQuirrell wasnt moving his lips.",
    "He lies...",
    "He lies...\n\nPotter come back here Quirrell shouted.",
    "Tell me the truth What did\nyou just see\n\nThe high voice spoke again.",
    "Let me speak to him... facetoface...\n\nMaster you are not strong enough\n\nI have strength enough... for this....\n\nHarry felt as if Devils Snare was rooting him to the spot.",
    "He couldnt\nmove a muscle.",
    "Petrified he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\nunwrap his turban.",
    "What was going on The turban fell away.",
    "Quirrells\nhead looked strangely small without it.",
    "Then he turned slowly on the\nspot.",
    "Harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound.",
    "Where there\nshould have been a back to Quirrells head there was a face the most\nterrible face Harry had ever seen.",
    "It was chalk white with glaring red\neyes and slits for nostrils like a snake.",
    "Harry Potter... it whispered.",
    "Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move.",
    "See what I have become the face said.",
    "Mere shadow and vapor ...",
    "I\nhave form only when I can share anothers body... but there have always\nbeen those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn\nblood has strengthened me these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell\ndrinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life\nI will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why dont you give\nme that Stone in your pocket\n\nSo he knew.",
    "The feeling suddenly surged back into Harrys legs.",
    "He\nstumbled backward.",
    "Dont be a fool snarled the face.",
    "Better save your own life and join\nme... or youll meet the same end as your parents....",
    "They died begging\nme for mercy...\n\nLIAR Harry shouted suddenly.",
    "Quirrell was walking backward at him so that Voldemort could still see\nhim.",
    "The evil face was now smiling.",
    "How touching... it hissed.",
    "I always value bravery...",
    "Yes boy your\nparents were brave....",
    "I killed your father first and he put up a\ncourageous fight... but your mother neednt have died... she was trying\nto protect you.... Now give me the Stone unless you want her to have\ndied in vain.",
    "NEVER\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM\nand the next second Harry felt Quirrells hand close on his wrist.",
    "At\nonce a needlesharp pain seared across Harrys scar his head felt as\nthough it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his\nmight and to his surprise Quirrell let go of him.",
    "The pain in his head\nlessened  he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone and\nsaw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers  they were blistering\nbefore his eyes.",
    "Seize him SEIZE HIM shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell lunged\nknocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands\naround Harrys neck  Harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain\nyet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.",
    "Master I cannot hold him  my hands  my hands\n\nAnd Quirrell though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees let go\nof his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms  Harry could see\nthey looked burned raw red and shiny.",
    "Then kill him fool and be done screeched Voldemort.",
    "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but Harry by\ninstinct reached up and grabbed Quirrells face \n\nAAAARGH\n\nQuirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then Harry knew\nQuirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible\npain  his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell keep him in enough\npain to stop him from doing a curse.",
    "Harry jumped to his feet caught Quirrell by the arm and hung on as\ntight as he could.",
    "Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off  the\npain in Harrys head was building  he couldnt see  he could only\nhear Quirrells terrible shrieks and Voldemorts yells of KILL HIM\nKILL HIM and other voices maybe in Harrys own head crying Harry\nHarry\n\nHe felt Quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and\nfell into blackness down ... down... down...\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him.",
    "The Snitch He tried to\ncatch it but his arms were too heavy.",
    "He blinked.",
    "It wasnt the Snitch at all.",
    "It was a pair of glasses.",
    "How\nstrange.",
    "He blinked again.",
    "The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view\nabove him.",
    "Good afternoon Harry said Dumbledore.",
    "Harry stared at him.",
    "Then he\nremembered Sir The Stone It was Quirrell Hes got the Stone Sir\nquick \n\nCalm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said\nDumbledore.",
    "Quirrell does not have the Stone.",
    "Then who does Sir I \n\nHarry please relax or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.",
    "Harry swallowed and looked around him.",
    "He realized he must be in the\nhospital wing.",
    "He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next\nto him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.",
    "Tokens from your friends and admirers said Dumbledore beaming.",
    "What\nhappened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\ncomplete secret so naturally the whole school knows.",
    "I believe your\nfriends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\nsend you a toilet seat.",
    "No doubt they thought it would amuse you.",
    "Madam\nPomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated\nit.",
    "How long have I been in here\n\nThree days.",
    "Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved\nyou have come round they have been extremely worried.",
    "But sit the Stone\n\nI see you are not to be distracted.",
    "Very well the Stone.",
    "Professor\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you.",
    "I arrived in time to\nprevent that although you were doing very well on your own I must say.",
    "You got there You got Hermiones owl\n\nWe must have crossed in midair.",
    "No sooner had I reached London than it\nbecame clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just\nleft.",
    "I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.",
    "It was you.",
    "I feared I might be too late.",
    "You nearly were I couldnt have kept him off the Stone much longer \n\nNot the Stone boy you  the effort involved nearly killed you.",
    "For\none terrible moment there I was afraid it had.",
    "As for the Stone it has\nbeen destroyed.",
    "Destroyed said Harry blankly.",
    "But your friend  Nicolas Flamel \n\nOh you know about Nicolas said Dumbledore sounding quite delighted.",
    "You did do the thing properly didnt you Well Nicolas and I have had\na little chat and agreed its all for the best.",
    "But that means he and his wife will die wont they\n\nThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then\nyes they will die.",
    "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harrys face.",
    "To one as young as you Im sure it seems incredible but to Nicolas\nand Perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long\nday.",
    "After all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great\nadventure.",
    "You know the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing.",
    "As\nmuch money and life as you could want The two things most human beings\nwould choose above all  the trouble is humans do have a knack of\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.",
    "Harry lay\nthere lost for words.",
    "Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the\nceiling.",
    "Sir said Harry.",
    "Ive been thinking... sir  even if the Stones\ngone Vol I mean YouKnow Who \n\nCall him Voldemort Harry.",
    "Always use the proper name for things.",
    "Fear\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Well Voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back\nisnt he I mean he hasnt gone has he\n\nNo Harry he has not.",
    "He is still out there somewhere perhaps looking\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive he cannot be killed.",
    "He left Quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers\nas his enemies.",
    "Nevertheless Harry while you may only have delayed his\nreturn to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\nfight what seems a losing battle next time  and if he is delayed\nagain and again why he may never return to power.",
    "Harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt.",
    "Then\nhe said Sir there are some other things Id like to know if you can\ntell me... things I want to know the truth about....",
    "The truth.",
    "Dumbledore sighed.",
    "It is a beautiful and terrible thing\nand should therefore be treated with great caution.",
    "However I shall\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to in which\ncase I beg youll forgive me.",
    "I shall not of course lie.",
    "Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\nto stop him from killing me.",
    "But why would he want to kill me in the\nfirst place\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.",
    "Alas the first thing you ask me I cannot tell you.",
    "Not today.",
    "Not\nnow.",
    "You will know one day... put it from your mind for now Harry.",
    "When you are older...",
    "I know you hate to hear this... when you are\nready you will know.",
    "And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.",
    "But why couldnt Quirrell touch me\n\nYour mother died to save you.",
    "If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\nunderstand it is love.",
    "He didnt realize that love as powerful as your\nmothers for you leaves its own mark.",
    "Not a scar no visible sign... to\nhave been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone\nwill give us some protection forever.",
    "It is in your very skin.",
    "Quirrell\nfull of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with Voldemort\ncould not touch you for this reason.",
    "It was agony to touch a person\nmarked by something so good.",
    "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.",
    "When he had found\nhis voice again Harry said And the invisibility cloak  do you know\nwho sent it to me\n\nAh  your father happened to leave it in my possession and I thought\nyou might like it.",
    "Dumbledores eyes twinkled.",
    "Useful things... your\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\nwhen he was here.",
    "And theres something else...\n\nFire away.",
    "Quirrell said Snape \n\nProfessor Snape Harry.",
    "Yes him  Quirrell said he hates me because\nhe hated my father.",
    "Is that true\n\nWell they did rather detest each other.",
    "Not unlike yourself and Mr.\nMalfoy.",
    "And then your father did something Snape could never forgive.",
    "What\n\nHe saved his life.",
    "What\n\nYes... said Dumbledore dreamily.",
    "Funny the way peoples minds work\nisnt it Professor Snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt....",
    "I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt\nthat would make him and your father even.",
    "Then he could go back to\nhating your fathers memory in peace....\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he\nstopped.",
    "And sir theres one more thing...\n\nJust the one\n\nHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror\n\nAh now Im glad you asked me that.",
    "It was one of my more brilliant\nideas and between you and me thats saying something.",
    "You see only\none who wanted to find the Stone  find it but not use it  would be\nable to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or\ndrinking Elixir of Life.",
    "My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now\nenough questions.",
    "I suggest you make a start on these sweets.",
    "Ah Bettie\nBotts Every Flavor Beans I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come\nacross a vomitflavored one and since then Im afraid Ive rather lost\nmy liking for them  but I think Ill be safe with a nice toffee dont\nyou\n\nHe smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth.",
    "Then he\nchoked and said Alas Ear wax\n\nMadam Pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict.",
    "Just five minutes Harry pleaded.",
    "Absolutely not.",
    "You let Professor Dumbledore in...\n\nWell of course that was the headmaster quite different.",
    "You need\nrest.",
    "I am resting look lying down and everything.",
    "Oh go on Madam\nPomfrey...\n\nOh very well she said.",
    "But five minutes only.",
    "And she let Ron and Hermione in.",
    "Harry\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but Harry was\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.",
    "Oh Harry we were sure you were going to  Dumbledore was so worried\n\n\nThe whole schools talking about it said Ron.",
    "What really happened\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors.",
    "Harry told them everything\nQuirrell the mirror the Stone and Voldemort.",
    "Ron and Hermione were a\nvery good audience they gasped in all the right places and when Harry\ntold them what was under Quirrells turban Hermione screamed out loud.",
    "So the Stones gone said Ron finally.",
    "Flamels just going to die\n\nThats what I said but Dumbledore thinks that  what was it  to\nthe wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure.",
    "I always said he was off his rocker said Ron looking quite impressed\nat how crazy his hero was.",
    "So what happened to you two said Harry.",
    "Well I got back all right said Hermione.",
    "I brought Ron round \nthat took a while  and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall  he already knew  he\njust said Harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the\nthird floor.",
    "Dyou think he meant you to do it said Ron.",
    "Sending you your\nfathers cloak and everything\n\nWell  Hermione exploded if he did  I mean to say thats terrible\n you could have been killed.",
    "No it isnt said Harry thoughtfully.",
    "Hes a funny man Dumbledore.",
    "I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance.",
    "I think he knows more or\nless everything that goes on here you know.",
    "I reckon he had a pretty\ngood idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just\ntaught us enough to help.",
    "I dont think it was an accident he let me\nfind out how the mirror worked.",
    "Its almost like he thought I had the\nright to face Voldemort if I could....\n\nYeah Dumbledores off his rocker all right said Ron proudly.",
    "Listen youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow.",
    "The\npoints are all in and Slytherin won of course  you missed the last\nQuidditch match we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you  but\nthe foodll be good.",
    "At that moment Madam Pomfrey bustled over.",
    "Youve had nearly fifteen minutes now OUT she said firmly.",
    "After a good nights sleep Harry felt nearly back to normal.",
    "I want to go to the feast he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened\nhis many candy boxes.",
    "I can cant I\n\nProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said\nstiffily as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didnt realize\nhow risky feasts could be.",
    "And you have another visitor.",
    "Oh good said Harry.",
    "Who is it\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke.",
    "As usual when he was\nindoors Hagrid looked too big to be allowed.",
    "He sat down next to Harry\ntook one look at him and burst into tears.",
    "Its  all  my  ruddy  fault he sobbed his face in his hands.",
    "I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy I told him It was the only\nthing he didnt know an I told him Yeh couldve died All fer a\ndragon egg Ill never drink again I should be chucked out an made ter\nlive as a Muggle\n\nHagrid said Harry shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\nremorse great tears leaking down into his beard.",
    "Hagrid hed have\nfound out somehow this is Voldemort were talking about hed have\nfound out even if you hadnt told him.",
    "Yeh couldve died sobbed Hagrid.",
    "An don say the name\n\nVOLDEMORT Harry bellowed and Hagrid was so shocked he stopped\ncrying.",
    "Ive met him and Im calling him by his name.",
    "Please cheer up\nHagrid we saved the Stone its gone he cant use it.",
